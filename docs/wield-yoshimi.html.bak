    <p><a href="http://yoshimi.sourceforge.net/">Yoshimi</a> is a very special
      software synthesizer. It is a significant rewrite and variation with new
      directions, after a fork from the <a href="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">ZynAddSubFX</a>
      project, which itself is deserving of tremendous congratulation. Both
      synthesize tone signals on the fly, in highly manipulable fashion. <a href="http://www.musically.me.uk/">Will

    <p>This is not to be construed as a dun of sampling and sample players.
      These are very helpful indeed, and quite essential, for delivery of many
      tones and tone colors, and this writer uses <a href="http://www.fluidsynth.org/">Fluidsynth</a>
      for many essential purposes.</p>
    <p> But there is tremendous power and flexibility inherent in live signal
      generation. With power comes the need for care&nbsp; ☺ Without, one may
      find one's tires meeting gravel and even brick walls, fairly quickly. Here
      are items which can help.</p>
    <h2>avoid distro burden</h2>
    <p> Automatic USB flash drive mounting can eat USB MIDI and audio
      performance and cause xruns (Jack audio and/or ALSA MIDI hiccups). There
      are other background things also, and some of them are very hard to find.
      Excellent results will obtain when your distro makes it easy for you to
      use only the tools you need. More on this in <a href="choosing.html">Choosing
        a Linux Platform for Live Synth</a>.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>prevent and eliminate overdrive</h2>
    <p> Overdriving can be a real problem. Just like in the world of real wires,
      preamps, and amplifiers, Yoshimi and other software tools can easily and
      inadvertently be set up to produce a digital “signal” which will overdrive
      whatever it is connected to in its little software universe, producing
      anything from distortion, to xruns -- momentary overload and hesitation of
      the JACK audio-data-carrying infrastructure -- to broad crashes in the
      very extreme case.</p>
    <h3 style=" margin-left: 40px;">reverb</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The most common cause of overdrive in my
      experiences, has been reverb.&nbsp; In the digital realm, "reverberation"
      is not a single algorithmic modification of a single stream of data:&nbsp;
      it is a most carefully calculated addition and refolding-back of input
      signals, in deliberate emulation of real echoes.&nbsp; So more and more
      and more data piles on.&nbsp; If you need a really serious reverberation
      for your goal, you will have to dedicate a lot of your system power to it:
      if I wanted to go extreme with reverb I would probably find a way to
      dedicate a whole <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/MultiJACK">MultiJACK</a>
      soft server to it and redesign/reroute accordingly.&nbsp; On the other
      hand, it might be better on the whole to just add a guitar-style stomp box
      outside of the synthesizer altogether, the guitar folks really do have
      their tools working well these days.</p>
    <h3 style=" margin-left: 40px;">stream mixing</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The other very common cause of overdrive I
      have had, is overload due to mixing of streams. The patch I use most, the
      Supermega Rumblic Organ, uses three independent Yoshimis each running two
      different patches, which produce three separate JACK output streams, all
      of which have to get crammed into the input of one triple stack of Calf
      filters, and thence towards the audio hardware.&nbsp; Overload occurred a
      lot.&nbsp; Eventually it occurred to me that the analogy of real copper
      might apply: if one takes the output of three physical keyboards being
      played at the same time and jams them into a triple Y adapter and thence
      into one amplifier, one will not be pleased with the result.&nbsp; So I
      tried several software mixers.&nbsp; I was not happy with their behavior,
      until I tried the marvelous <a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?page=Non%20Mixer">Non-Mixer</a>
      by Jonathan Moore Liles.&nbsp; Very nice, very easy to set it up with
      exactly the inputs and outputs one needs, and all of them wire up with
      JACK.&nbsp; Smooth, beautiful, controllable!</p>
    <h3 style=" margin-left: 40px;">an audio filter called compressor</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition to mixing, I also use an audio
      filter called a compressor, as the last item in my Calf chain.&nbsp; This
      helps keep things under yet more control.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When one applies an audio compressor, if the
      range of volume of a given signal runs too soft or too loud or both, the
      device will sense it, and change (compress) the amplitude range, to that
      which is appropriate for the particular PA, particular venue, particular
      audience, et cetera.&nbsp; It changes the range gently, in a controllable
      curve, so that it is not perceived as other than a deep part of the
      moment.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For quite a while, also, I have been using the
      multiband Calf compressor.&nbsp; This is because I find that I sometimes
      get overdrive in only certain areas of the audio spectrum, so I keep just
      those areas under maximum control.&nbsp; The whole idea, after all, is to
      produce the most profound, edgy, soul-driving tonage we can right?&nbsp;
      So clearly we don't want to "tone down" anything we don't have to tone
      down!</p>
    <h2>special to the digital realm</h2>
    <p>As is discussed in reverb above, the digital realm is different in many
      ways from the analogue.&nbsp; There are many more ways this plays out.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Most Linux audio tools are quite functional with lower-powered CPUs, and
      yet maximum potential is far out of sight even with big server-class
      hardware. For instance, one instance of Yoshimi, can be configured to (try
      to) deliver sixteen different CPU-intensive tones at once, from a single
      MIDI command. But on my AMD 8-core, I run three Yoshimis at once
      sometimes, because this distributes the load among all those CPUs. The
      result of careful design of this kind, is the most profound tonality I
      have ever had available to my hands.<br>
      <br>
      The multi-CPU tool htop, which has a powerful full-screen text UI, can be
      very helpful to figure out what is going on. It is worthwhile to realize
      that sometimes your Yoshimis will not be taking all of your CPU, but
      you'll still get xruns and overload conditions; this is likely the
      overdrive mentioned above. A VU meter applet placed in your Jackd setup in
      a location to receive everything being sent to the outputs, can help
      verify this. <br>
      <br>
      Here are a few methods of approach.<br>
      <br>
      The first is multi-Yoshimi. The last time I tried a multi-ZAFSX approach,
      the result was a total hardware lockup; not a CPU limitation, but
      something much worse. The fact that multi-Yoshimi works so well, is one of
      its many joys. Use htop, and if your single Yoshimi is using most of one
      CPU core, try two or three separate instances.<br>
      <br>
      The second is polyphony. In Yoshimi's main screen there is a setting for
      maximum simultaneous notes. Try reducing.&nbsp; But not too much.&nbsp;
      There is a lot of wiggle room in other places.<br>
      <br>
      If you use reverb within Yoshimi patches – and many have them within – you
      may find good reason to change things according to the readouts of htop. I
      have found it much more efficient, to apply reverb and other filters using
      Calf, as separate JACK process elements, “after the fact” if you will. My
      own semistandard approach, is to use zero reverb in my Yoshimis, and then
      pipe them all to a stack of Calf plugins, starting with EQ, then Reverb,
      then Multiband Compression.</p>
    <h2>when the numbers don't add up: MultiJACK</h2>
    <p>The current BNR does not route all audio data through one JACK process,
      as is usual at this writing.&nbsp; This is because despite quite a lot of
      work on the above items, I was seeing strange results:&nbsp; I was using
      10-20% of my big 4GHz octocore CPU, and yet my one JACK process was
      showing 75% of its capacity used.&nbsp; There was a whole lot of advice
      given to just give up at this point, suggesting in effect that I just
      could not get more out of the one box than I was getting.&nbsp; Which
      struck me as ridiculous, although the advisers were primary sources!&nbsp;
      After about two and a half years, however, something called <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/MultiJACK">MultiJACK</a>
      emerged, in which multiple JACK servers are connected by IP within the
      single box.&nbsp; This has eliminated the problem entirely.&nbsp; </p>
