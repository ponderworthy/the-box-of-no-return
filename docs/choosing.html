      Choosing a Linux Platform for a Musical Synthesizer</h1>
    <h2> Distributions and General</h2>
    There are many distributions today, and all of them have strengths. There
    have been some relatively recent divergences in best applications. At this
    time we will not recommend CentOS or Red Hat on the digital audio
    workstation; we need the full range of current audio libraries, audio
    applications, kernels and drivers...<br>
    <br>
    For a long while, in my experiences, this generally meant the Testing
    release of Debian. Sparky Linux, a very nicely engineered
    best-of-many-versions Debian, has also been excellent. There is an Ubuntu
    variant for this sort of audio too, reportedly very good, and there are
    others.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I have found Manjaro to be my personal best choice, because given just a
    touch of recompilation arcana, 'yaourt' makes it so very easy to build and
    install everything we need, and even optimized for the CPU at hand,
    including the fastest kernels available. Manjaro is an Arch superset, which
    is a very good thing in many ways, not the least bit being the unusually
    thorough Arch documentation wiki, and the growing Manjaro wiki.<br>
    <br>
    Do see Desktop Manager below, because you'll want to start off as smoothly
    as possible.<br>
    <h2>Hardware, Compatibility, and Related Theory</h2>
    <br>
    One must watch the hardware. You'll know when you don't have enough CPU
    power to fill your bill; JACK will tell you quite reliably about the
    percentage of your software DSP capacity in use, and htop is great to show
    you real multicore status. Concerning compatibility, new kernels will
    support new hardware; if you're running a model of sound card which is
    entirely new in the current year, you may need a very new kernel indeed.<br>
    <br>
    But not all sound cards are worthwhile for us: we need low latency, which
    empirically means “works very well and processes its data very fast”; more
    about this further down. Having been burned by more than one sound card
    which was widely claimed to be such, I recommend care. All kinds of
    motherboard sound, not surprisingly, seem to be widely supported, but any
    very new hardware may need a new kernel to support it. See the Kernels
    section, below.<br>
    <br>
    Primary support for sound, in today's Linux, is either in the kernel for
    PCI/PCI-e/USB, or it is in the Firewire setup for Jack, called FFADO. There
    are other avenues – there are ways to retrofit newer versions of the ALSA
    sound system found in the kernel, to older kernel versions, and there is an
    entirely alternative sound system called OSS about which reports are often
    good – but these involve digging and replacement of pillars of stock distro
    elements, and this is time and concentration which I am not going to spend
    away from the music :-D<br>
    <br>
    Some Hardware Practica<br>
    <br>
    For about three years the first BNR was run using a Behringer FCA202
    firewire audio interface for sound, and a Yamaha UX16 for MIDI. I still
    heartily recommend the UX16. But the Behringer died unexpectedly (right
    before a gig, it was given to come back just once after prayer), Behringer
    lists it as a “Legacy” product, and I have not found a comparable non-legacy
    product at anywhere near the price: the impression I have is that in reality
    the industry is taking firewire in general into the legacy category. So in
    the rebuild occurring right now (2017-08-21) of BNR #1, I found this new USB
    device from Peavey, the USB-P, which so far has been just precisely what's
    needed, it even includes a lot of internal signal cleanup which is quite
    precious for this project. I am also trying out a Roland UM-ONE mk2 USB MIDI
    interface; it was a bit less expensive than my traditional UX16's, and
    Roland invented a lot of what we now call MIDI, so I thought it would be a
    worthwhile go.<br>
    <br>
    The first BNR is played with the Ponderworthy band and occasional solo gigs;
    there is a second BNR, which is played every Sunday morning at New Hope UMC
    in Topeka, Kansas. The second is not considered portable, uses a
    seven-year-old dual-core 3.3GHz PC and motherboard audio 1/8“ jack, and a
    UX16.<br>
    <br>
    Desktop Manager<br>
    <br>
    The choice of desktop manager can also make a big difference. Today we have
    quite a few more choices than we used to have; there is forking going on et
    cetera. It is useful to notice that the forking is going on, in part,
    explicitly to get away from the huge horsepower-and-memory-chomping graphics
    shells and fancy environmental add-ons which the very largest distro
    managements appear to think everyone wants. For synth, where we want every
    free cycle we can get, I heartily recommend an environment called LXDE,
    which can now be installed automatically by the package managers of any
    distro I would consider. There are others I have tested and used for
    periods, but thus far LXDE has given by far the best combination of speed,
    reliability, and lack of interference with our purposes here.<br>
    <br>
    Interference is the major concern. One cause of this is something called
    gvfs, which although it is very nice to have in the general-purpose desktop,
    will often get in the way of smooth high-performance realtime audio, it
    causes cutouts in the audio called “xruns”, producing static and skips. So
    far I have seen LXDE use gvfs as an option, not as a make-or-break, so LXDE
    I very much recommend. For quite a while one of my two BNRs ran XFCE instead
    of LXDE, and ran it very well; but in the current rebuild (August 2017) I
    found that XFCE gave me occasional xruns but LXDE did not, so back to LXDE
    it is.<br>
    <br>
    Background Processes and Other Hidden Gotchas<br>
    <br>
    There are many more issues which can hinder us. Anything which interrupts or
    inhibits the algorithmic delivery of the tonal datastream and signal to the
    audio hardware, and anything which unnecessarily eats processor cycles, may
    need to be addressed. These include certain automatic USB flash drive
    mounters (which is one of the functions of gvfs), PulseAudio, some
    Bluetooth-related items, and many others.<br>
    <br>
    PulseAudio, the de facto consumer/general-purpose audio transport, is a good
    case in point. A number of years ago PulseAudio was a very significant
    gotcha on almost every distro I tried, it just would not cooperate with
    JACK. But the two have begun to cooperate much more. It is now possible to
    keep Pulse around in a rig like we are discussing here – but you will
    sacrifice some of your available DSP. Yesterday's test showed 0.5% without
    Pulse, and about 5% in use with Pulse, without any applications attached. So
    I got rid of Pulse :-)<br>
    <br>
    Kernels<br>
    <br>
    The kernel is the root core of the OS; nothing happens without the kernel,
    and a significant improvement in the kernel is usually a major improvement
    in everything else. One major benefit of Debian Testing and Sparky Linux, is
    we get to use the very high-performance kernels being put out by Liquorix.
    These are not only highly tweaked for speed and responsiveness, but they
    also are using very recent kernel code versions, which means the most
    complete driver sets which exist for Linux, and support of the most recent
    hardware available. On Manjaro, 'yaourt' gives many more options; I am
    currently using linux-pf-bfq, recompiled full tickless, 1000 Hz timer, CPU
    optimization native. I have found better performance available using
    non-realtime kernels, for some reason.<br>
