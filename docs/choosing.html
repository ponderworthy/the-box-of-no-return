      Choosing Linux Platform Elements for a Musical Synthesizer</h1>
    <h2>distributions and general</h2>
    <p>There are many distributions today, and all of them have strengths. There
      have been some relatively recent divergences in best applications. At this
      time we will not recommend CentOS or Red Hat on the digital audio
      workstation; we need the full range of current audio libraries, audio
      applications, and of course kernels and drivers.</p>
    <p>For a long while, in my experiences, this generally meant the Testing
      release of Debian. Sparky Linux, a&nbsp; best-of-many-versions Debian, has
      also been excellent. There is an Ubuntu variant for this sort of audio
      too, reportedly very good, and there are others.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I have found Manjaro to be my personal best choice, because given just a
      touch of recompilation arcana, 'yaourt' makes it so very easy to build and
      install everything we need, and even optimized for the CPU at hand,
      including the fastest kernels available. Manjaro is an Arch superset,
      which is a very good thing in many ways, not the least bit being the
      unusually thorough Arch documentation wiki, and the growing Manjaro wiki.</p>
    <p>Do see "desktop environment" below, because you'll want to start off as
      smoothly as possible.&nbsp; But we do need to talk about hardware.</p>
    <h2>audio hardware</h2>
    <p>Not all sound cards are worthwhile for us: we need low latency, which
      empirically means “works very well and processes its data very
      fast”.&nbsp; Having been burned by more than one sound card which were
      claimed to be such, I recommend care and flexibility.&nbsp; All kinds of
      motherboard sound, not surprisingly, seem to be widely supported, but any
      very new hardware may need a new kernel to support it (see the Kernels
      section below).&nbsp; But it's not just support that we need, we need
      quality.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>One of the obvious items, is the sampling rate.&nbsp; Consumer-grade
      audio generally will input and output a maximum of 48 kHz.&nbsp; (The
      original audio CD sampled at 44.1 kHz.)&nbsp; Modern professional-grade
      recording apparatus will handle 96 kHz and sometimes 192 kHz.&nbsp; If
      your hardware and software and Linux setup is all excellent, I can confirm
      that a Mackie Onyx Artist USB interface will deliver 96 kHz very nicely,
      and also, I can confirm that if your patches include thready strings or
      smoothness, you will notice significant improvement over 48 kHz.&nbsp; On
      the other hand, I can also confirm that dozens of people in various places
      will demand that you recant if you claim to notice the difference.&nbsp;
      Just before the Mackie I used the 48 kHz Peavey USB-P, which does work
      extremely well and provides a highly protected and garbage-filtered XLR
      output.</p>
    <h2>audio support in Linux</h2>
    <p>There are a number of important items for audio support in Linux.&nbsp;
      Here are some practical definitions which will help you a lot in
      understanding what comes next.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ALSA.&nbsp; This was originally imagined, at least by many, as the
        be-all audio handler for Linux.&nbsp; Sound card designers today can be
        expected to (a) align their work with current ALSA drivers, (b) help
        develop new ones at least by releasing hardware details, or (c) despise
        all of their potential Linux-oriented customers.&nbsp; There is quite a
        bit of code out there which tries to use direct ALSA to do everything,
        including Youtube, DAW, MIDI, network transport, you name it; and some
        of it is very current, especially for low RAM and embedded use.&nbsp;
        However, quite a while ago Real Programmers (of which this author can
        only describe himself as a second or third cousin or so, possibly by
        marriage twice removed) increasingly decided that ALSA alone was not
        cutting it, so more layers were born.&nbsp; The vast majority of useful
        Linux audio-related application code today, is set up at least
        optionally to interface directly with other layers, and the other layers
        use ALSA for its excellent driver set and lowest-level configuration.</li>
      <li>PulseAudio.&nbsp; This layer has the primary purpose of helping common
        desktop applications play fair with each other, and mixing all of their
        streams into the speakers, so that nothing crashes while something else
        is trying to boop.&nbsp; The various applications don't have to know
        about each other at all; Pulse is a nice friendly being which lets
        anything compatible plug into it, and a whole lot of things do.&nbsp; It
        does inputs too, and multiple outputs, and over-the-network delivery to
        other Pulse-ready machines on the LAN, and all rather nicely.&nbsp; But
        there is no user-friendly way to, say, take the audio output of two
        video player applications, mix one through an independent time-delay
        filter app and the other through a separate reverb filter app, with
        submillisecond time-stamp synchronization so that everything can be
        resynchronized back with the frames of the video.&nbsp; For this we need
        JACK.</li>
      <li>JACK.&nbsp; JACK is an amazing piece of work.&nbsp; It is software
        which runs in the background, again allowing JACK-compatible
        applications to attach to it.&nbsp; But unlike Pulse, which in general
        just delivers to the default output, JACK doesn't presume anything, and
        relies on its companion tools to encourage the user to make connections
        between its clients.&nbsp; There are some very nice GUIs for this now
        which make things very nice indeed.&nbsp; There is also the "transport"
        capability, which is frame-timestamping; professional-grade video and
        other setups in Linux use this to keep various streams in submillisecond
        synchronization, and it works very well.&nbsp; There is also
        over-the-LAN networking support, of two different breeds, and there are
        Windows and Mac versions too.</li>
      <li>FFADO.&nbsp; This is really an adjunct to JACK, a JACK-oriented driver
        set for FireWire devices.&nbsp; If you use FireWire audio, you may need
        this.&nbsp; It's not quite as common as it used to be, because recent
        ALSA developments include ALSA drivers for FireWire devices, for quite a
        while there weren't any.&nbsp; But my last FireWire device, a Behringer
        FCA202, ran much better using FFADO than using the ALSA driver which I
        was surprised to find after a couple of years.&nbsp; So I told JACK to
        not use ALSA, to use its FireWire mode instead (which is FFADO), and all
        remained well.</li>
      <li>OSS.&nbsp; OSS today is an alternative to ALSA, a different audio
        hardware driver set.&nbsp; It predates ALSA in origin.&nbsp; I have
        received very good reports of it, though it does not support anywhere
        near the range of sound hardware as ALSA does.&nbsp; But certainly I
        would try it if there was cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>desktop environment</h2>
    <p>The choice of desktop environment can make a big difference. Today we
      have quite a few more choices than we used to have; there have been
      forks.&nbsp; It is useful to notice that the forking happened, in part,
      explicitly to get away from the huge horsepower-and-memory-chomping
      graphics shells and fancy environmental add-ons which the very largest
      distro managements appear to think everyone wants. For a BNR, where we
      want every free cycle we can get, I heartily recommend an environment
      called LXDE, which can now be installed automatically by the package
      managers of any distro I would consider.&nbsp; As of recently I can also
      recommend XFCE4, at least as setup in Manjaro's default.</p>
    <p>Interference is the major concern. The most common is something called
      gvfs, which although it is very nice to have in the general-purpose
      desktop, will often get in the way of smooth high-performance realtime
      audio, it causes cutouts in the audio called “xruns”, producing static and
      skips. So far I have seen LXDE use gvfs as an option, not as a
      make-or-break, so LXDE I very much recommend.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of most
      recently, XFCE4 from Manjaro likewise makes it very easy to remove gvfs.</p>
    <h2>background processes and other hidden gotchas</h2>
    <p> There are many more issues which can hinder us. Anything which
      interrupts or inhibits the algorithmic delivery of the tonal datastream
      and signal to the audio hardware, and anything which unnecessarily eats
      processor cycles, may need to be addressed. These include certain
      automatic USB flash drive mounters (which is one of the functions of
      gvfs), PulseAudio, some Bluetooth-related items, and many others.</p>
    <p>PulseAudio, the de facto consumer/general-purpose audio transport, is a
      good case in point. A number of years ago PulseAudio was a very
      significant gotcha on almost every distro I tried, it just would not
      cooperate with JACK. But the two have begun to cooperate much more. It is
      now possible to keep Pulse around in a rig like we are discussing here –
      but you will sacrifice some of your available JACK capacity. Yesterday's
      test showed 0.5% without Pulse, and about 5% in use with Pulse, without
      any applications attached. So in my production BNRs I do get rid of
      Pulse.&nbsp; But I don't have to do so anymore, because MultiJACK is much
      more efficient, I don't need that 4.5% to run well.&nbsp; If I ever build
      a desktop BNR, one intended to run usually as a desktop but then to be
      brought into "BNR mode" sometimes, I will leave PulseAudio in, and even
      gvfs now, the most recent build has seen both of them work much less
      intrusively. </p>
    <h2>system checkout</h2>
    <p>There's just one tool this writer has heard of which does this well, and
      that's something called realTimeConfigQuickScan. It helps you find tweaks
      helpful and essential, though its reporting is a bit out of date at this
      writing.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>setup of JACK</h2>
    <p>For a very long time, a tool called "qjackctl" was the universal
      all-purpose tool for getting JACK to work.&nbsp; It is GUI, and it
      contained everything needed, automating every parameter of JACK (and there
      are a whole lot of them).&nbsp; However, everything changes.&nbsp; Today
      the setup tool recommended by the JACK developers, is called Cadence, and
      it is amazing, particularly so to those who struggled with qjackctl for
      extended sessions ☺ Cadence handles Pulse/JACK cooperation setup, among
      other things, and it comes with a wiring tool and other interesting things
      too.</p>
    <h2>kernels</h2>
    <p> The kernel is the root core of the OS; nothing happens without the
      kernel, and a significant improvement in the kernel is usually a major
      improvement in everything else. One major benefit of Debian Testing and
      Sparky Linux, is we get to use the very high-performance kernels being put
      out by Liquorix. These are not only highly tweaked for speed and
      responsiveness, but they also are using very recent kernel code versions,
      which means the most complete driver sets which exist for Linux, and
      support of the most recent hardware available. On Manjaro, 'yaourt' gives
      many more options, but my latest BNR build uses the default Manjaro
      kernel, which is set up very nicely for our needs.&nbsp; There is
      something called a "realtime kernel" which used to be helpful, but in
      recent years I have found better performance available using non-realtime
      kernels, for some reason.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in custom kernel building, my last custom which I
      enjoyed greatly was linux-pf-bfq, recompiled full tickless, 1000 Hz timer,
      CPU optimization native. </p>
