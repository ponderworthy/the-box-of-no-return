    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>The Box of No Return is a Linux-based musical synthesizer platform,
      suitable for live musicianship, designed to handle multiple patches with
      enormous demands, and switch between them with zero delay and zero
      cutout.&nbsp; If you sit in your home studio and use single SoundFonts
      with a laptop and simple GUI, you don't need this.&nbsp; If you play live,
      and pile on the tone generators and filters in patch development in order
      to feel and deliver the unyielding power of the musical harmonic roar, an
      implementation of the BNR may suit you well.&nbsp; There are obviously
      middle grounds too ☺, and there are articles here to help in general.</p>
    <h2>questions, contributions, discussion, the code</h2>
    <p>The project and its code are <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/the-box-of-no-return"
        target="_blank">hosted on Github</a>.&nbsp; There are SF2 SoundFonts
      involved in the current build which are downloadable <a href="https://archive.org/details/SonatinaSymphonicOrchestraSF2"
        target="_blank">here</a>; these are conversions of the Sonatina
      Symphonic Orchestra, original SFZs being <a href="http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/download.html"

    <h2>why this project and its benefits</h2>
    <p>From the beginning, the BNR was built out of a need to host patches of
      maximum, profound and terrible, tonal content. If you find yourself
      reducing the profundity of your patches because your machine won't do
      better, this project may be very good for you, especially if you play
      live. Current patches include one with three simultaneous Yoshimis,
      another with five simultaneous large FluidSynth soundfonts, and the
      ability to mix the two and a third together. Many prayers granted, and
      much help from the Linux Audio community, study, work, and trial and
      error, has gone into making this happen reliably and well.<br>
      <br>
      The current known box running with this code, is an eight-core 4GHz
      machine with 8G RAM. In an earlier iteration, it used the conventional
      single JACK server; but less than one-quarter of its CPU capacity was
      being used, while JACK reported that 75% of its capacity was being used.
      In 2015 began an effort, now successful, to use multiple JACK processes
      together in one box, and this is the rebuild of the BNR with MultiJACK at
      its core. Attempts have not yet been made to run this code on a quad-core
      box, though the previous single-JACK iteration of the BNR is still running
      as of this writing on quad 3GHz with 8G RAM.<br>
      <br>
      There are quite a few people using tools like NetJACK to increase JACK
      capacity with multiple boxes, or at least multiple motherboards. But if
      you value portability, if you value space, and/or if you are a gigging
      musician, a fragile or heavy (one, the other, or both; not neither)
      multi-motherboard construct is not preferable. Most users of
      Linux-hardware synths limit themselves as a result of what one JACK server
      can do, and other platforms limit analogously; here we have an effort to
      blow the door open just a bit more.</p>
