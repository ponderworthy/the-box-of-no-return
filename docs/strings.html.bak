      Towards Maximum Strings </h1>
    <p>In addition to development on the Supermega Rumblic Organ, I have been
      enjoying Strings sounds for a long while. My favorites have been called
      “Strings” and “Strings Section” and the like, on a variety of keyboards.</p>
    <p>But I have steadily realized that I want a rather extreme range of
      tonality and expression under my fingers. First of all, I want
      toilet-seat-rumbling bass available like the S.R.O.! It also has to be
      very controllable, so the black-velvet-pillow effect is very close at
      hand. But it should have a beautiful low-midrange of celli, and highs
      which can range from gentle to powerful but never screechy; the highests
      needs to be playable as soft but very very very clear.</p>
    <p>This is quite the tall order for one 88-key spread, or even three or
      four, and I had never been convinced it was practical. But one day the
      band leader at the church came up with a really profound song which just
      begged for all of it, so I began looking at the problem yet again.</p>
    <h2>tools</h2>
    <p>For this purpose, over the years, I have tried quite a few different
      toolsets, and many different standalone keyboards. For a long while I
      could not get strings up to the quite nice bar set in my Yamaha MO8 and
      similar instruments. But then there was an architecture change ☺ </p>
    <p>In other words, my venerable AMD second-generation X4 box was wearing
      out. It was starting to get just a little unpredictable, boot times
      changing without easily identifiable cause, occasional weird and
      thoroughly unknown sounds out the audio, et cetera. So finding the Creator
      having given satisfactory wherewithal, I spent the same amount which many
      pay at consumer electronics stores for an ordinary office desktop, for an
      eight-core AMD, 4GHz without overlocking (!). The source is used is no
      longer selling them, alas, but there are still a few which work to that
      standard.&nbsp; I then began studying what could be improved. As it
      happens, there was lots of room for it.</p>
    <h2>first step: lots of tone</h2>
    <p>The first thing I tried was throwing as much good strings-tone as seemed
      to make some kind of sense, into the mix. So looking around a lot, I found
      and obtained the <a href="http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/download.html">Sonatina
        Symphonic Orchestra</a> soundfonts, which include more than twelve
      different strings, ranging from double bass to violin, several in sets.
      The SSO originals ship in SFZ form, and after much study it appeared that
      the only current Linux SFZ player is LinuxSampler, so I set it all up, and
      tested. Glorious bass, with a very nice friendly personality, omitting the
      flat roar element of previous setups. Midrange very nice indeed, the best
      I had tried; mid-highs excellent. Highs still screechy.</p>
    <h2>second step: 96KHz</h2>
    <p>Dealing with the screech was tough. The third or fourth big thing I
      tried, was changing from 48KHz audio to 96KHz audio. Quite the big change
      actually, because relatively few people are using 96KHz, it puts quite the
      added load on everything, software and hardware. But that gave me the most
      beautiful feather-highs, the like of which I have never heard from
      anything else, and this hardware can take it with room to spare!!!</p>
    <h2> but then a dose of reality</h2>
    <p>I noticed that after playing for short whiles, between 5 and 15 minutes,
      static was creeping in. This was quite mysterious, I had never seen this
      before; it was not xruns, no errors showing up anywhere, just a bit of
      static every so often, increasing very slowly over time. I searched far
      and wide, and asked a number of people excellent in the field; the best
      suggestion appeared to be that 96KHz was just too much for some of the
      elements of my software chain. So I started switching out components a
      bit. And then a lot. The same thing happened with many different
      variations on LinuxSampler running the SFZ's, so I began using an <a href="https://archive.org/details/SonatinaSymphonicOrchestraSF2">SF2
        version of the SSO</a>, and tried that in QSynth, FluidSynth by itself,
      LinuxSampler, and Carla. Carla I had the most hope for, it is a very nice
      concept and generally great implementation; but the static problem
      remained. So then I tried the Calf FluidSynth plugin – and voilà.
      Lovely!&nbsp; Not quite the gorgeous thready of the 96kHz, but very nice
      indeed.</p>
    <h2>and the pesky overload problem</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure whether other Linux musicians face this as much as I do. It
      may very well be that I do tend to try to stuff more audio signal into the
      stream than most – I do remember managing to get a hexagonal peg in a
      round hole in nursery school.&nbsp; But regardless, this is a case where
      every MIDI trigger note is going to result in cascades of signal out, and
      we do have to be careful to handle it well. Happily, the first thing I
      tried for this has been working very well: a mixer application. For some
      time I have been using Non-Mixer: I set up one input channel for each of
      my several Calf FluidSynth soundfont tone generators, and all of them are
      gently and gracefully mixed into output channels. Wonderful!</p>
    <h2>and finally, after years, back to 96kHz</h2>
    <p>It bothered me a lot that I had to compromise my tone quality.&nbsp; I
      was not using more than 20% of the big octo's CPU, and yet I could not get
      things to work as desired.&nbsp; The concept for <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/MultiJACK">MultiJACK</a>
      emerged, and is now in place most wonderfully&nbsp;☺ &nbsp; 96 kHz, still
      about 25-30% of the big octo's CPU in use, and all the tone I can
      use.&nbsp; Hallelujah!</p>
