    <h1>The Box of No Return</h1>
    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>The Box of No Return is a Linux-based musical synthesizer platform,
      suitable for live musicianship, designed to handle multiple patches with
      enormous demands, and switch between them with zero delay and zero
      cutout.&nbsp; If you are using a simple SoundFont host on a laptop and
      basic GUI, you don't need this.&nbsp; If you pile on the tone generators
      and filters in patch development, but when playing you don't want any UI
      at all except patch number buttons on your controller in order to feel the
      unwavering power of the musical harmonic roar, the BNR may suit you very
      well indeed.</p>

    <p>Linux-based musical synthesis is an interesting discipline, as is music
      through synthesis in general.&nbsp; A few articles are <a href="articles.html">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>why this project and its benefits</h2>
    <p>From the beginning, the BNR was desired out of a need to host patches of
      maximum, profound and terrible, tonal content. If you find yourself
      reducing the profundity of your patches because your machine won't do
      better, this project may be very good for you, especially if you play
      live. Current patches include one with three simultaneous <a href="http://yoshimi.github.io/"
        target="_blank">Yoshimi</a>s, another with five simultaneous large
      FluidSynth soundfonts, others, and more consisting of mixes.&nbsp; Many
      prayers granted, and much help from the Linux Audio community, study,
      work, and trial and error, has gone into making this happen reliably and
      well.<br>
      <br>
      The current known box running with this code, is an eight-core 4GHz
      machine with 8G RAM. In an earlier iteration, it used the conventional
      single JACK server with a huge tangled web of connections; but less than
      one-quarter of its CPU capacity was being used, while JACK reported that
      75% of its capacity was being used. In 2015 began an effort, in 2017
      finally successful, to use multiple JACK processes together in one box,
      which is called MultiJACK; and this build of the BNR has MultiJACK at its
      core. Attempts have not yet been made to run this code on a quad-core box,
      though the previous single-JACK iteration of the BNR is still running as
      of this writing on quad 3GHz with 8G RAM.<br>
      <br>
      There are quite a few people using tools like NetJACK to increase JACK
      capacity with multiple boxes, or at least multiple motherboards. But if
      you value portability, if you value space, and/or if you are a gigging
      musician, a fragile or heavy <em>(one, the other, or both; not neither)</em>
      multi-motherboard construct is not preferable. Most users of
      Linux-hardware synths limit themselves as a result of what one JACK server
      can do, and other platforms limit analogously; here we have an effort to
      blow the door open a bit more!</p>
    <h2>grateful thanks</h2>
    <p>go to the many people of the Linux audio community, from the original OSS
      people to the ALSA folks, and to the JACK people (all of you, including
      the very wise several who said this project could <strong>not</strong>
      produce good results, because nonetheless you help tremendously); and
      clearly the GNU/Linux folks as a whole, who have given us all so much; and
      the Creator who keeps it all happening.</p>
