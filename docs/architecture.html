      <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Architecture</span></h1>
    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>The architecture of the Box of No Return uses multiple JACK servers in
      tandem, connected by IP transport over localhost.&nbsp; MIDI is handled by
      ALSA directly at this writing, though a mixture of ALSA and JACK MIDI is
      planned.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>'soft' and 'hard' servers</h2>
    <p>In the current BNR, there is one 'hard server', which is a JACK server
      connected via ALSA to the single audio output.&nbsp; The hard server is
      configured and tested initially via Cadence, and then this configuration
      is transferred into jack_control statements residing in
      BOOT-INITIAL.sh.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hard server does not do anything besides
      receive audio from the soft servers, over the localhost network via a tool
      called zita-n2j, part of the zita-n2jbridge package, and deliver it to the
      audio hardware.</p>
    <p>There are also three 'soft servers', which areJACK servers not connected
      to any hardware, these run the "dummy" JACK driver.&nbsp; In each soft
      server, audio signal generation connects to filters and/or mixer, and
      thence to zita-j2n, which sends the signal over the network to the hard
      server.</p>
    <p>This use of multiple JACK servers in one box is called <a href="https://github.com/ponderworthy/MultiJACK">MultiJACK</a>.</p>
    <p>To see the connections, <a href="images/hard-server-connections.png" target="_blank">click
        here for the hard server</a>, <a href="images/soft1-server-connections.png"
        target="_blank">here for soft server #1</a>, <a href="images/soft2-server-connections.png"
        target="_blank">here for soft server #2</a>, and <a href="images/soft3-server-connections.png"
        target="_blank">here for soft server #3</a>.&nbsp; To see the hard
      server connections in a live BNR, one can simply run 'catia'; for soft
      server #1, one can run './soft1 catia', and so on.</p>
    <p>You may notice that ALSA MIDI connections, in green, are replicated
      across all of them.&nbsp; This is because although Catia is set to show
      ALSA MIDI, ALSA MIDI is fully independent of JACK: though there are four
      JACK servers running, there is just one ALSA system for any machine.</p>
    <h2>midi</h2>
    <p>ALSA (non-JACK) MIDI is very well-supported, and worthwhile JACK wiring
      GUIs support it.&nbsp; So in the current configuration, the hard server
      doesn't touch MIDI at all.&nbsp; There is a tool called a2jmidid, which is
      a background service normally used to set up a single bridge between ALSA
      MIDI and JACK MIDI on a usual single-server setup; but this tool ships
      with something else called a2jmidi_bridge, which can be run multiple times
      manually.&nbsp; And this is how it is working at this writing, one
      a2jmidi_bridge per soft server, delivering MIDI via ALSA alone from the
      hardware direct into each soft server.</p>
    <p>There is a likely future change of the MIDI side of things. The one
      problem with ALSA MIDI, for a very long time, has been that it requires
      powering the keyboard off and then on after the BNR is booted, before it
      will do anything.&nbsp; I have no idea why this is true, I have asked it a
      lot.&nbsp; And JACK MIDI does not have this problem.&nbsp; So in theory,
      one could take the MIDI input on the hard server using JACK MIDI, pass it
      along to all of those a2jmidi_bridges, and thence into the soft
      servers.&nbsp; Have to make sure there's not too much additional delay on
      the MIDI with that, but it's not expected to be a problem.</p>
    <p>MIDI-over-IP using <a href="https://qmidinet.sourceforge.io/">qmidinet</a>,
      was attempted, but qmidinet does not appear able (at this writing) to run
      multiple times on one box, it is not yet clear why.</p>
    <h2>control</h2>
    <p>So we have a collection of patches, of JACK audio toolchains, and we want
      to be able to select between them.&nbsp; Not only that, we want to choose
      between them quickly on the fly, in the middle of a song, with zero delay,
      and with zero cutout, we don't want anything unmusical or unsmooth to
      happen.&nbsp; Even a hardware keyboard can't do that!&nbsp; What shall we
      do?</p>
    <p>Well, after a number of years and stages, what we do is we use something
      called 'mididings', which lets us make little custom applets which route
      and change MIDI signals in many ways.&nbsp; We make just one called
      'Distribute', which has one MIDI input port, and three output ports as of
      this writing.&nbsp; We run one copy of this same Distribute script (to
      keep things as simple as possible!) on each soft server.&nbsp; The three
      output ports are named SRO, Strings, and FlowBells.&nbsp; The logic in the
      applet, which is written in the Python language, and runs like this (do
      note that all tone generators respond to channel 1 only):</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All non-note commands -- e.g., pedal commands
      -- are sent to all of the ports, and converted to channel 1, so that if I
      need to bring everything off at once, I just&nbsp; release the sustain
      pedal as I would anyhow.&nbsp; </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If MIDI signals are received which are of MIDI
      channel 1, note-commands are sent to the SRO output port
      only.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If MIDI signals are received which are of MIDI
      channel 2, note-commands are converted to channel 1, and sent to the
      Strings output port only.&nbsp; </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> </div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If MIDI signals are received which are of MIDI
      channel 3, note-commands are sent to both SRO and Strings output ports,
      velocities are adjusted to avoid overload and create the precise balance
      desired, and the commands are converted to channel 1.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>And so on.&nbsp; Right now there are five channels in use on the input
      side, and more are in development now that MultiJACK is in use.&nbsp; The
      idea, though, is that all of the tone-producing JACK chains are live and
      hot all of the time, and it is simply that signal flows when and as called
      for.&nbsp; All I have to do is set the MIDI channel output from the
      keyboard, which is a very common thing to be able to do on the fly, and
      the MIDI channel of the note commands is changed, which tells Distribute
      which of its directions to go.&nbsp; Works beautifully, no delays, <em>extremely</em>
      live and right-now.&nbsp; Takes doing on the build side, but when you're
      live and playing, it's one button per patch and the soul stays in the
      music.&nbsp; Not bad.</p>
    <h2>configuration</h2>
    <p>Before MultiJACK, configuration was in fairly common pattern, though
      rather more complex than most because of all of those JACK chains active
      at the same time.&nbsp; With MultiJACK at the core, each JACK server is
      configured separately while everything is running, so one can focus on one
      JACK chain at once.&nbsp; I will post screenshots fairly soon.&nbsp; For
      now, just realize that:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">catia</p>
    <p>by itself will bring up the Catia JACK and ALSA MIDI wiring GUI showing
      just the hard server (and ALSA MIDI if ALSA MIDI is turned on in Catia),
      whereas</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=SOFT1 bash -c catia</p>
    <p>will bring up catia showing just soft server #1, and ALSA MIDI if ALSA
      MIDI is turned on.&nbsp; Thus as long as one concentrates on remembering
      one's Catia context and the independent ALSA MIDI overlay, it all
      works!&nbsp; The code includes bash scripts to make the distinction
      simpler; I configured the whole with:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">./soft1 catia</p>
    <p>et cetera, which helped a lot.</p>
    <h2>saving JACK and MIDI connections</h2>
    <p>One more item for now.&nbsp; We can set JACK and ALSA MIDI connections
      via Catia, but we cannot save them thus to be remembered across a reboot
      or even a JACK server restart.&nbsp; aj-snapshot is the tool in place for
      this.&nbsp; If we rewire SOFT1, we execute:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">./soft1 aj-snapshot AJSOFT1.xml</p>
    <p>which then saves all of the connections visible from Catia running in
      soft server #1.&nbsp; ALSA MIDI connetions get saved multiply, for each
      server, but this is not a problem, aj-snapshot won't try to duplicate,
      when it reads its files, at the end of BOOT-GENERAL.py.</p>
    <h2>a complication starting JACK clients</h2>
    <p>Every application or applet using JACK for either audio or MIDI signals,
      is a "client" of a JACK server.&nbsp; Early in BNR development I noticed a
      problem starting JACK clients automatically: the first would load fine,
      the second and the rest would crash, often crashing the JACK server
      itself.&nbsp; BOOT-GENERAL.py starts up all of the JACK clients in the
      BNR, and it is written in Python because the solution to the problem was
      to not just start JACK clients, but to start each one carefully, make sure
      it came up and settled well, and sometimes even make sure its ports were
      visible in JACK, before continuing to the next.&nbsp; If you see startup
      problems, the first thing to do is to add detection items after every
      single client, customizing for the clients' port names and the like.</p>
