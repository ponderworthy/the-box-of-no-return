0.  linux-xanmod works just fine when compiled with native CPU.
At this writing, 5.2.6, its compilation via 'yay' failed.
The below are non-default settings we need for the BNR for
other kernels, e.g., linux-lqx and linux-rt-bfq

1.  CONFIG_HZ_1000

Timer frequency.  Needed for very rapid responses / low latencies.

2.  CONFIG_MNATIVE

Compile optimized for the CPU this system has.

3.  CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL

Full dynaticks.  Unclear what the downsides are if any.

4.  CONFIG_PREEMPT

Fully preemptible low-latency desktop.
In linux-rt or any other realtime kernel, there is
an option further in this area.
