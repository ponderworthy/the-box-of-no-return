The spawn code in jpctrl.py has to have JACK server name capability
through environment variable change.

Need to check and revise code for all True/False return values.
Done.

Need to revise jpctrl.py and BOOT-GENERAL.py.  jpctrl.py
used a single jack_client variable, external, until
this MultiJACK BNR rewrite.  New design:
- BOOT-GENERAL.py needs to have four jack_client
variables, one per JACK server
- These get used economically, as needed
- These get closed/removed cleanly after
all BOOT-GENERAL operations are done.

Found that the github integration plugin bundled with
'atom', does not build on Linux.  Installed PyCharm.
Very nice.  Github integration very sweetly simple.
Handles bash too.  Set up github sync, did first commit.
Love it.

Used yaourt [this is Manjaro after all] and installed
Mididings.  It installs for python2.  Ran it.  Seems to
work fine with python2.

Added atom-runner to atom, runs scripts:
Hit Ctrl+R (Alt+R on Win/Linux) to launch the runner for the active window.
Hit Ctrl+Shift+R (Alt+Shift+R on Win/Linux) to run the currently selected text in the active window.
Hit Ctrl+Shift+C to kill a currently running process.
Hit Escape to close the runner window.

Will set up github synchronization.

Built and installed Mididings.
Did not run under python3, errored.
Did not run under python2, not found.
Posted Issue in github for mididings.

Moved all to ~/BNR.  Logs will go to ~ for now.

Mididings.
Most recent version appears here:
https://github.com/dsacre/mididings
Built and installed from source according to readme instructions.
Has not seen updates since 2015 at the latest.
Don't know that it needs updates.  Probably not.
Just in case, a few possibles here:
https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/midi_apps
A GUI option found here, don't know that it does note range selection:

ALSA Modular Synth is reported to have this capability.
Its SourceForge is down.  kxstudio appears to be helping the project.

Now need plan for Distribute.
This is mididings.  This has to run on the hard server,
because it has to interact with real hardware.
MIDI.
ALSA MIDI, not anything else at this time.  Might eventually transition
to JACK MIDI over IP.  Will have to do the transition if all JACK
servers cannot see ALSA MIDI at the same time.  There is a
manual op for a2jmidid analogous to multi-JACK server starts,
will try this first.

Revisited wait_for_jack code near beginning of BOOT-GENERAL.py.
Tested in live python3.  Working.

Tested jpctrl JACK server check primitives.  All appear working.

Set clock_source to 0 in BOOT-INITIAL.sh for hard server.
0.3% DSP load with four (4) JACK servers running !!!!

Found JACK setting to use HPET, is causing jack.Client to fail.
Found HPET and RTC docs:
https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#hpet
with optimizations.  Immediate optimizations:
--
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/60-max-user-freq.conf
echo -n 3072 | sudo tee /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/max_user_freq
sudo chmod 660 /dev/hpet /dev/rtc0
sudo chgrp audio /dev/hpet /dev/rtc0
--
The n.p.c standard is set in sysctl.d/bnr.conf, then added the above
to rc.local.
Also added this to /etc/sysctl.d/bnf.conf :
dev.hpet.max-user-freq=3072

Found BOOT-INITIAL.sh still using DAC (the Peavey).  Set it to use O12 (oh one two), the Mackie.
Probably no USB power management issue.

In morning, default JACK was apparently broken, stopped, would not start.  Could be USB power management?
Disabled USB power management with /etc/modprobe.d/usb-autosuspend.conf .

Did find that Python True/False has to have capital first letters.

Mackie works at 96000/64, 0.7ms latency.  Set all JACK processes to this.

Old HD install will not boot.  Will build new.
