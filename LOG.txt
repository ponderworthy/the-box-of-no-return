Installed net-tools-debian-ifconfig with yaourt
and then ran 'ifconfig lo multicast' to enable
multicast on localhost.
Was not able to run two qmidinet processes
on the one machine, even by binding one to lo
and the other to hardware NIC.

qmidinet:
https://qmidinet.sourceforge.io
seems to be the Linux MIDI-over-IP
method currently extant.  There are
a few OSC-over-IP methods which may be
more common, but qmidinet is in
good development, and we would have to
add a conversion step for the OSC
to be useful.  qmidinet does use multicast.

Could make backup with:

Tests now passing with flying colors.
Only catch is typical ALSA MIDI behavior,
may have to power keyboard off/on after
all processes started.

Ready for production-style tests.  Video is
sometimes a problem for headless, et cetera.

Studied ./soft1 catia and CPU levels.  JACK DSP
rising to 91% plus, CPU not rising similarly.
Checked Calf filters for SRO.  Found Calf reverb
producing huge overload when notes pile.  Turned its
output down to about 10%.  Set Small Room instead
of Tunnel-Like, intended to do that long ago for
tonal reasons.  Very very very nice.  No overload.

Set period of JACK soft servers to 256, leaving
period of hard server at 128.  Improvement.  Not enough.

Set Yoshimi internal buffer size to 512, they were 256.
No change.

Ran ./soft1 catia when testing at high load.  DSP
% shot up to 91% very quickly.  (High load is defined
as holding the sustain pedal down and rapidly hitting
SRO notes.)

Yoshimis were set to 48000 under ALSA.  Set them to 96000.
No change.

Set zita --buff to 14 for all soft servers.  No change.

Improved, not enough.  Set --filt to 32.  No change.
Probably need to keep --filt to 24 or so and then add
something new.  Perhaps --buff, although --buff is for
network jitter and we're localhost.  Might be the moment
to take Yoshimi to single-process.  Perhaps multi-instance
single-process, perhaps combine all.  If need to use
immediately, probably reducing from 96K would help a lot.

xruns at very high load using SRO.  Momentary cutouts.
Not surprising, this is the highest-powered patch at the moment.
It appears to be overload of the zita resampling protocols.
One or both sides of the zita connectors restart or reengage
spontaneously.  Self-healing.  Impressive.
Automatic --filt is 16.  Setting --filt to 20.

Completed revision of startup sequence.  Appears solid.
Best method appears to be to run it all in/from an lxterminal,
the lxterminal being run by the 'boot' script.

Found that by using the NAME argument to a2jmidi_bridge, giving
each port an appropriate name, aj-snapshot became deconfused and
wired them all, and also, the audio attack zzt in Yoshimi went
away (no clue why).

Note for future reference.  Using:
  ./soft1 catia
to see and edit soft server #1's JACK and ALSA connections.  Using:
  ./soft3 aj-snapshot AJSOFT3.xml
to save soft server #3's JACK and ALSA connections.

So far, recompiling the Calf plugins and Yoshimi, from
original source, with optimizations as below.

Set up Roland UM-ONE USB MIDI interface to keyboard.
Found that if I run Catia on the hard server, with ALSA MIDI
visible, I can wire the USB-ONE's output to all three of the visible
a2j_bridge ALSA MIDI ports.  And it worked.  Audio not quite
smooth on the attack.  Automatic rewiring via aj-snapshot
only connected one of the three ports.  Investigating.

The next highest usage is Yoshimi, not surprisingly given setup.
7-8% each, several.  Won't touch this yet, next priority is MIDI/control.

Tested full run again.
Now four listings 13-14% each,
and the 40% on-and-off is entirely gone.

Set in /etc/makepkg.conf:
CFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O3 -msse4.2 -mavx -mfpmath=sse -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -fno-plt"
CXXFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O3 -msse4.2 -mavx -mfpmath=sse -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -fno-plt"

Arch's 'pbget' lets us bring in PKGBUILD for any package.
Need package python3-memoizedb for 'pbget'.

Recompiled calf set from source.
First need install lilv, lv2 libraries.
Found the following needs changed in the configure script:
---
if test "$set_enable_sse" = "yes"; then
  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -O3 -march=native -mtune=native -msse4.2 -mavx -mfpmath=sse"
  fi
---
then configure:
./configure --enable-sse --enable-experimental
then 'make', then 'sudo make install'

Studied CPU usage via htop.
Found that by far the most power is being used by calf plugins, surprisingly.
Four listings, 14-15% each.
One CPU is being pushed to 40% on and off and off again, visibly.
Will CPU-optimize calf plugins.

Wired all, saved with aj-snapshots, tested Yoshimi
sound engine in toto.
Working!!!

Now rewriting Distribute as Distribute.py.
Using named output ports, to make it
a lot easier, hopefully, to understand
JACK wiring.

All processes appear to be functional!!!!!!

Found, after much thrashing, that if we create multiple
jack.Client objects and attach each to a different JACK
server, it doesn't work, they all see the ports on
the first.  Have no idea why.  Have posted query to
the jack.Client github issues area with sample code.
It affects us in exactly one way: wait_for_jackport
and relatives cannot be built to take jack.Client objects,
they have to create their own JACK clients at each
function run.  This is not terrible, it's just
mildly inefficient.  Recoded for this, keeping the
old code available in the files for possible
future reference.

Found that spawn_and_settle may not be sending processes
appropriate environment for JACK server selection.  Testing.

Realized MIDI architecture needs to be established.
- If we run a2jmidi_bridge on each soft server we
should be able to connect each soft server to MIDI
hardware, through ALSA.
- This does require a separate Distribute process for each
JACK soft server, and none on the hard server.
- They can all be exactly the same Distribute code.
- Given that we are designing for most effective (not stingy)
use of truly ample CPU and RAM, this is probably the best,
because it keeps the stage count at a minimum for each
MIDI signal sent and received.
- Even though each Distribute process will be considerably
larger than necessary, using the same code (the same
executable script!) for each will keep the system as a whole
as simple as possible.

Copied back working files from previous production set.
Added .calfpresets to the git repo set.

Syntax checking complete.  Recoded to permit flexible paths,
using ~/BNR.

First draft coding appears done.  Now syntax checking.
python -m py_compile yourpythonscript.py

The spawn code in jpctrl.py has to have JACK server name capability
through environment variable change.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2231227/python-subprocess-popen-with-a-modified-environment

Need to check and revise code for all True/False return values.
Done.

Need to revise jpctrl.py and BOOT-GENERAL.py.  jpctrl.py
used a single jack_client variable, external, until
this MultiJACK BNR rewrite.  New design:
- BOOT-GENERAL.py needs to have four jack_client
variables, one per JACK server
- These get used economically, as needed
- These get closed/removed cleanly after
all BOOT-GENERAL operations are done.

Found that the github integration plugin bundled with
'atom', does not build on Linux.  Installed PyCharm.
Very nice.  Github integration very sweetly simple.
Handles bash too.  Set up github sync, did first commit.
Love it.

Used yaourt [this is Manjaro after all] and installed
Mididings.  It installs for python2.  Ran it.  Seems to
work fine with python2.

Built and installed Mididings.
Did not run under python3, errored.
Did not run under python2, not found.
Posted Issue in github for mididings.

Moved all to ~/BNR.  Logs will go to ~ for now.

Mididings.
Most recent version appears here:
https://github.com/dsacre/mididings
Built and installed from source according to readme instructions.
Has not seen updates since 2015 at the latest.
Don't know that it needs updates.  Probably not.
Just in case, a few possibles here:
https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/midi_apps
A GUI option found here, don't know that it does note range selection:
https://open-music-kontrollers.ch/lv2/midi_matrix/
ALSA Modular Synth is reported to have this capability.
Its SourceForge is down.  kxstudio appears to be helping the project.
http://linuxsynths.com/AMSPatchesDemos/alsamodularsynth.html


Now need plan for Distribute.
This is mididings.  This has to run on the hard server,
because it has to interact with real hardware.
MIDI.
ALSA MIDI, not anything else at this time.  Might eventually transition
to JACK MIDI over IP.  Will have to do the transition if all JACK
servers cannot see ALSA MIDI at the same time.  There is a
manual op for a2jmidid analogous to multi-JACK server starts,
will try this first.

Revisited wait_for_jack code near beginning of BOOT-GENERAL.py.
Tested in live python3.  Working.

Tested jpctrl JACK server check primitives.  All appear working.

Set clock_source to 0 in BOOT-INITIAL.sh for hard server.
0.3% DSP load with four (4) JACK servers running !!!!

Found JACK setting to use HPET, is causing jack.Client to fail.
Found HPET and RTC docs:
https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#hpet
with optimizations.  Immediate optimizations:
--
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/60-max-user-freq.conf
echo -n 3072 | sudo tee /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/max_user_freq
sudo chmod 660 /dev/hpet /dev/rtc0
sudo chgrp audio /dev/hpet /dev/rtc0
--
Added yaourt package rc.local.d, placed the above in /etc/rc.local.d/bnr .
--
The n.p.c standard is set in sysctl.d/bnr.conf.
---
Also added this to /etc/sysctl.d/bnr.conf :
dev.hpet.max-user-freq=3072

Removed all pulseaudio items except libraries.

Installed 'cadence' using yaourt.

These optimizations go in /etc/makepkg.conf :
-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -msse4.2 -mavx -mfpmath=sse"

Power management on the CPU.  Set 'performance' governor in
/etc/default/cpupower .  Did not appear to do anything.
Will use sudo'd item in boot script.

Using, in makepkg.conf, CFLAGS:
-march=native -mtune=native -O3 -msse4.2 -mavx -mfpmath=sse

There is an item in /etc/sudoers.d which contains an override for 'wheel'.
Need to fix this so 'wheel' can do sudo without password.
