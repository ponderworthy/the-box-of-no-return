Version 3.2.2 - Oct 31 2020
---------------------------
* IMPROVED
- Glockenspiel
  - there was a small click at the very end of each Glockenspiel note.
     Instead of loop_mode=one_shot, I now use a long decay instead which 
     prevents the click from being heard (this issue was accidentally 
     introduced. The original source file does not have this problem)
  - added standard randomization to Glockenspiel

* BUGS FIXED
- added extra blank lines before first <region> in french-horn-SEC-sustain-DXF.json
   to ensure first <region> starts on a new line (could have caused problems for 
   some .sfz players)
- french-horn-sec-sustain-DXF for notes b1-f2 need an extra carriage return in the
  .sfz file to prevent issues with 2 command being on the same line for some
  sfz players. This may have been affecting other patches based on french-horn-sec-sustain-DXF
  as well

Version 3.2.1.1 - Apr 24 2020
-----------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- contrabassoon and "all-woodwinds" patches had upper case / lower case issues
with file paths on Linux causing a file not found error
(thanks to Aaron Walker for finding this)
- bass clarinet and bass trombone had the same uppercase / lowercase issue
(thanks to Dmitri (Dimitris).Giannos for finding this)


Version 3.2.1 - Apr 13 2020
---------------------------
* IMPROVED
- adjusted pitch of Flute SEC Sustain g5-f6
- e3 sounded like it had too much vibrato for some reason so now 3_Bb-PB-loop.wav
is used to play e3 instead of 3_Db-PB-loop.wav
- randomization of stacc and sus patches is now consistently 
this
  pitch_random=12
  amp_random=1.5 
  delay_random=0.012

instead of mostly but not always this
  pitch_random=5
  amp_random=1


Version 3.2 - Nov 23 2019
-------------------------
* ADDED
- more articulations for ensemble patches (sustain, staccato, accent etc)
- sustain choir patches

* IMPROVED
- adjusted tuning of CELLO-SEC for a4-c5
- adjusted tuning of CELLO-SEC for c4-d4
- adjusted tuning of CELLO-SEC for f#2-g#2
- adjusted tuning of CELLO-SEC for d#2-f2
- adjusted tuning of CELLO-SEC for c2-d2
- bass trombone SOLO removed sample c#3 - due to buzz noise
- bass trombone SOLO improved sound of e3

* BUGS FIXED
- tubular bells are now mono
- MIXED, MALE, FEMALE choir now share the same attack, decay etc. settings
- slightly adjusted panning of FEMALE singers in the MIXED choir 

Version 3.1.2 - March 1 2019
------------------------------
* ADDED 
These were accidentally omitted since 3.0
- 1st-violin-SOLO-KS-C3
- 1st-violin-SEC-KS-C3
- 2nd-violin-SOLO-KS-C3
- 2nd-violin-SEC-KS-C3

* IMPROVED
- cello SEC sustain, improved a few notes by shifting which samples were
triggered by which notes
- cello SEC staccato, improved a few notes by shifting which samples were
triggered by which notes
- cello SEC, removed sample SEC 3_E-PB-loop.wav, note sounded weak when 
compared to others, stretched 3_Db-PB-loop.wav instead
- cello SOLO sustain, removed extra vibrato
- cello SOLO sustain, adjusted key mapping for a few notes to improve 
   sustained vibrato (vibrato becomes too fast if low notes stretched too high)
- now using "xf_cccurve=gain", instead of default "xf_cccurve=power" for cross
fade patches (-DXF) for smoother transition between samples 
as suggested by (Zeger Knaepen)
- All sustain strings, now using ampeg_vel2release for legato like
transition between slowly played string notes which means the slower the 
note is played, the longer the decay so it overlaps better with the next note.
(as suggested by Zeger Knaepen)
- timpani - replaced artificial round robin with randomized pitch for
humanization of each hit

* BUGS FIXED
- french-horn-SEC-sustain-DXF - removed an old comment
- timpani-hit - moved an inline comment to a line by itself. Inline
   comments have been known to cause trouble for at least one .sfz player

Version 3.1.1 - October 8 2018
------------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- enabled Sforzando to properly handle sustain pedal such that
CC64 values 0-63 are "sustain off" as per the MIDI spec instead of just
0 being used for "sustain off".
- corrected instrument list for 1st violins, 2nd violins to warn of potential
need to transpose to reach upper notes as well as mention the C3 keyswitch option

Version 3.1 - June 12, 2018
----------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- clarinet-SOLO : relocated an inline comment that could cause problems for
some sfz players
- timpani-KS-C6.sfz, there was no sound until a key switch was selected because
the default was not set correctly in the file.
- clarinet SOLO and clarinet SEC, highest note was C7, should only be Bb6
- documentation directory was missing the .css file for the instrument lists

* ADDED
- alto flute, bass clarinet, contrabassoon, bass trombone, celesta
- contrabassoon to all-woodwinds-SOLO-normal-modwheel.sfz, 
                   all-woodwinds-SOLO-normal-modwheel-panned.sfz, 
                   all-woodwinds-SEC-normal-modwheel.sfz,
                   all-woodwinds-SEC-normal-modwheel-panned.sfz

Version 3.0 - Feb 10, 2018
-------------------------
- renamed change-log.txt to change-log-standard-orchestra.txt

* BUGS FIXED
- 1st violin solo e4 (lowest E) was not playing on some MAC systems
  This has to do with the use of key=65 without also specfifying BOTH
   lokey=64 and hikey=65. This fix should now work with both MAC and Linux
   systems
- clarinet-SEC-staccato.sfz, the attack was too long so staccato notes
   lasted too long and didn't sound very staccato
- restored randomization of 1st-violin-SEC-sustain notes
- corrected a minor documentation error in most SEC-KS files
- piccolo and flute had been shifted so all notes were playable on a 61 key
  MIDI controller. These instuments have been restored to their proper octaves.
  To get the notes to appear in their proper range on a piano roll or staff.
- trombone-SEC-sustain, the low volume sample of E2 (lowest note) was not
   being played
- trumpet-SEC-staccato.sfz, volume adjustments were not being properly applied
    to low volume samples
- all-brass-SEC-panned.sfz, all-brass-SOLO-panned.sfz, all-brass-SEC-panned-DXF.sfz,
   all-brass-SEC-panned-DXF.sfz, all had incorrect panning settings
- Glockenspiel.sfz had been shifted down 2 octaves to fit on a 61 key MIDI controller
   It has now been mapped to match the pitch of the piano note that plays it
   (i.e. it has been shifted back up 2 octaves where it belongs)
- Glockenspiel.sfz - the lowest note F5 was not being played

* IMPROVED
- added noise reduction to 1st-violins-SEC-sustain note E5
- reduced delay between accent and sustain of flute SOLO accent, flute SEC accent
    notes
- 2nd-violin-SOLO-staccato notes G2 .. B2 were too scratchy
- 2nd-violin-SOLO-staccato notes were too harsh in general, applied some EQ
- adjusted tuning on bassoon-SEC-staccato.sfz
- added some EQ to timpani (hits and rolls) to add extra clarity to the sound

* REPLACED
- trombone-SOLO-staccato samples, this also affects the accent articulation.
  The previous staccato sounded too different from sustain samples

* DELETED
- To maintain consistency of all key switches appearing at C2 or C6 as needed
  the following have been deleted
  - bassoon-SEC-KS-F5.sfz
  - bassoon-SOLO-KS-F5.sfz
  - oboe-SEC-KS-C3.sfz
  - oboe-SOLO-KS-C3.sfz
  - timpani-KS-C5.sfz

* ADDED
- flute-SOLO-KS-C3.sfz, flute-SEC-KS-C3.sfz, piccolo-SOLO-KS-C3.sfz
    To use these, transpose the MIDI up an octave so that the C3 key switches
    will work at C2 and the MIDI notes will fit on a standard 61 key MIDI controller.
    Unshifted, the flute, piccolo notes will appear in the proper place in the
    piano roll or on a musical the staff than they should.
- timpani-KS-C6.sfz so that all key switches exist as either C2 or C6
- timpani-LR.sfz - instead of round robin hits, this give you individual access
   to right and left hand hits
- string-bass-SEC-KS-C7.sfz to provide key switches at C6 when string bass
  MIDI is transposed up an octave to appear at the correct pitch on a musical
  staff
- tuba-SOLO-KS-C6.sfz, bass-SEC-C6.sfz, bass-SOLO-C6.sfz
- a higher pitch triangle (in misc.sfz - at G2, G#2, A2)
- a higher pitch cymbal (in cymbals.sfz & bassdrum-snare-cymbals.sfz - D#4, A#4)
- timpani-KS-C6.sfz so that all key switches exist as either C2 or C6
- timpani-LR.sfz - instead of round robin hits, this provides individual access
   to right and left hand hits

* MOVED
- all samples (.wav files) are now in a separate samples release file
- change log for all percussion and patches other that woodwinds, strings and
brass now appear in a different change log file "change-log-Other.txt"

Version 2.3 - Aug 10 2017
-------------------------
* ADDED
- dynamic cross faded brass patches (-DXF) for solo and section
   trumpets, french horns, trombones

- bassoon-SOLO-KS-C6, bassoon-SEC-KS-C6
   - just to provide a more consistent key switching option
     instead of KS-F5

- timpani-hit-n-roll.sfz
  - this is just timpani hits from c3-c4, timpani rolls from c5-c7
    for those that would rather use timpani hits/rolls this way
    rather than with key switches

- bassdrum.sfz, cymbals.sfz, snare.sfz
  - these were added to make bassdrum, cymbals, snare available to be
    independantly placed in the stereo field

* IMPROVED
- 2nd violins SEC tremolo - A5 and A6 were too loud
- slightly increased clarinet section sustain release time
- blended 1st sec tremolo and 1st solo tremolo for better 1st sec tremolo sound
- blended 2nd sec tremolo and 1st solo tremolo for better 2nd sec tremolo sound
- blended viola sec tremolo and 1st solo tremolo for better viola sec tremolo sound

Version 2.2 - Apr 20 2017
-------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- corrected a volume setting in all-brass-SEC-normal and all-brass-SOLO-normal
   patches where a volume was set to 0.030.2
- 1st violin solo e4 (lowest E) was not playing on some Linux related
    systems
- 2nd violin solo was not properly constructed from 1st violin solo
   since version 2.0
- choir-MALE-normal-mod-wheel.sfz had redundant volume settings
- choir-MIXED-normal-mod-wheel.sfz had redundant volume settings
- oboe-SEC-staccato.sfz volumes were far too low

- corrected many patches where scripted adjustments were undone
   by version 2.0 when samples were renamed to indicate they
   had been looped but the old name was still used in the script so
   the scripted adjustments were not applied

- repositioned all inline comments (causes problems on some tablets)
  - comments now always appear on a line by themselves

* IMPROVED
- slightly reduced duration of oboe-SOLO-staccato.sfz notes

Version 2.01 - Mar 22 2017
--------------------------
- removed oboe-SEC-sustain-test.sfz (left over from testing)

Version 2.0 - Mar 20 2017

* REPLACED
- all tremolo samples (new tremolo is also less noisy)
- Viola Sec Sustain
- Trumpet Sec Sustain
- Trombone Solo Staccato
- Trombone Sec Sustain
- Timpani Roll

* LOOPED
- ALL sustain samples
- ALL tremolo samples
- ALL choir samples
- timpani samples

* BUGS FIXED
- Trombone-sus.mf.F#2-PB.wav was not mapped to cover G2
- removed vibrato on solo clarinets (vibrato not typically used
   by clarinets in an orchestra)
- fixed bug in flute-SOLO-accent.sfz where delay was set to a negative number
   which could cause sustain portion of sound to be muted
- half the time, xylophone C6 (which is heard when playing C4 on the keyboard)
  was sounding like C7. This has been fixed.

* IMPROVED
[ Woodwinds ]
- removed a squeak sound from the the 6-Ab.wav in flute-SEC-sustain.sfz
  (also affects anything derived from flute-SEC-sustain.sfz)
- adjusted tuning on a few notes from bassoon-SEC-sustain.sfz
- improved some notes in oboe-SOLO-accent.sfz
- removed EQ from oboe-SEC-sustain.sfz after comment that oboes were
   souding a little too weak
- removed click in c#6 in oboe-SEC-sustain.sfz
- adjusted Bb, B in oboe-SEC-normal-mod-wheel, they sounded accented
- corrected volume of g3 in bassoon-SEC-sustain.sfz

[ Strings ]

   (was always playing back as mono but .wav files were still in stereo)
- adjusted tuning on solo and section bass sustain
- removed delay before each harp note
- reduced noise (a hissing sound) on harp D2, F2
- adjusted volume of some 1st and 2nd violin solo pizzicato notes
- slightly slowed the attack of 1st-violin-SEC-sustain,
   2nd-violin-SEC-sustain, violo-SEC-sustain
   to further separate "sustain" from "normal" articulation
- slightly adjusted cello-SEC-attack timing beetween accent and sustain

[ Brass ]
- improved crossover between mf and ff for solo trumpet
- added 2nd velocity layer to solo trombone
- adjusted tone and volume of solo trumpet sustain
- reworked solo trombone sustain to get a better tone
- adjusted split point between samples in French-Horn-SEC-sustain and
  Trombone-SEC-sustain, Trombone-SOLO-sustain so that loud samples begin
  playing at a higher velocity. This makes playing soft passages easier
  while still being able to play loud when needed
- re-looped Trombone-SEC-sustain Eb_p.wav sample
- slightly reduced volume of tuba SOLO staccato C2, C#2, D2

[ Vocals ]

Version 1.11 - Nov 16 2016
--------------------------
- cello-SOLO-sustain note 3_A, was cut short. It has now been re-looped

Version 1.1 - Nov 14 2016
-------------------------
- in bassdrum-snare-cymbals.sfz,
  - the "Cymbals 2 Long Roll" (key=A4) played the entire sample every time,
     now respects the midi note length
  - had "Cymbals 1 Crash" mapped to e4 instead of c#4
  - adjusted length of early release on cymbal rolls
    (one release was too short, others were too long)
  - adjusted "Cymbals 1 Crash" (key=C#4) and "Cymbals 2 Crash" (key=F#4)
    so that short notes represent closed crash, long notes represent open
    ringing crash
- removed <control> opcode from bassoon-SEC files, was causing an error
  when all-woodwinds-SEC-normal-mod-wheel.sfz was created
- removed <control> opcode from
    viola-SOLO-pizzicato,
