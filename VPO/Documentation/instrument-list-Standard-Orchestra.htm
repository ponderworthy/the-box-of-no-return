<h1>Standard Orchestra Notes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Key switches are assigned to the following notes, with "n" representing where the key switches start<br />
    <br />
    Cn = Sustain (default) <br />
    C#n = Tremolo (only for string section) <br />
    Dn = Normal / General Purpose (mod wheel changes length of note attack) <br />
    D#n = Accent (an accented sustain) <br />
    En = Staccato <br />
    Fn = Pizzicato (only for strings, of course)<br />
  </li>
	<li>
    There seems to be some confusion about use of the mod wheel. The mod wheel will only have
    an effect on the attack of the samples (how long it takes for the sound to reach
    it's volume after a key is pressed) on patches labelled "normal-mod-wheel"
  </li>
</ul>

          - Trumpet, French Horn, Trombone also have dynamic cross faded (-DXF) versions of all of the above articulations, such that the mod wheel can be used to control the volume and blending of low and high velocity layers to enable crescendo, decrescendo during a held note.<br /><br />
          - Dynamic Cross Faded (-DXF) versions of "Normal Mod Wheel" (called "Normal-DXF"), use cc73 (attack time) to control the attack  of the samples, and mod wheel to control the volume and dynamic cross fade.
