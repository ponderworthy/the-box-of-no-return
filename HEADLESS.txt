    Install normally, using monitor and keyboard. Get the install solid 
    with updates and testing.

    Switch to a virtual console with Ctrl-Alt-F2 and log in.

    Run this to turn off X: sudo systemctl isolate multi-user

    Run this: X -configure

    A file is created, /root/xorg.conf.new.

    chdir to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

    Move /root/xorg.conf.new to this new name at your current location: 
    ./10-monitor.conf Reboot and test. If you change video cards, you 
    may well have to do it again, and youâ€™ll probably need to boot from 
    install media in order to remove the file.
