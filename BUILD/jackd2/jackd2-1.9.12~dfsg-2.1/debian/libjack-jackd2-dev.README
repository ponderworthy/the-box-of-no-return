libjack*-dev: JACK Audio Connection Kit (development files)
-----------------------------------------------------------

You'll find the API documentation in the
/usr/share/doc/libjack*-dev/HTML directory.

The source code of the example clients is not included in the binary
packages, please get the source package if you need it (by doing
"apt-get source jack-audio-connection-kit", for example).

Some (and more user-specific) documentation is also contained in the
jackd package.
