  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Fix FTBFS with GCC 7.  Closes: #853461
  * Revert "libjackserver is a private library and does not need to be exported"
    It may even be a private library, but it's in a public namespace, so it
    needs to be dealt with as public.
    This reverts commit f1b2acff8fc96b2692206ecc2c0ac57043410569.
    Closes: #872831

  * Enable jackdbus
  * Rename jack_rec to jackrec (as done in jackd1)
  * Include (updated) manpages from jackd1

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Repackage source:
    + Strip binary code (shared libraries for MacOS X and Windows).
    + Strip unneeded sources copyright-protected without licence.
    + Isolate as patch 0000 changes between tarball release and upstream
      SVN trunk as of revision 3968.
  * Sync control.in with latest hand-edited changes to control.
  * Add myself as uploader.
  * Drop old Vcs-Bzr stanza from control.
  * Fix tighten libasound-dev build-dependency to at least 1.0.18.
  * Lower debhelper build-dependency to 6, to ease backporting (we need
    no newer features anyway).
    Fix bump debhelper compat level to match build-dependency.
  * Update patch handling:
    + Use source format "3.0 (quilt)" (not CDBS simple-patchsys.mk).
    + Unfuzz.
    + Refresh, compacting with quilt --no-timestamps --no-index -pab.
    + Rename with leading number, and add README to source documenting
      micro naming scheme.
    + Add DEP3 header to patch 1001 "earlier connect.diff").
    + Unpatch as last clean target to please both git-buildpackage and
      source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Update watch file:
    + Track jackd2 releases.
    + Handle DFSG mangling.
    + Add usage hint.
  * Fix non-unix line-ends in PO files.
  * Tidy build routines:
    + Drop install hints automagically handled by CDBS already.
    + Separate configure from build in rules file.
    + Avoid unneeded ifeq construct in rules file.
    + Use single space in multi-line fields of control file.
    + Mention use of 'waf distclean' when upstream ships cleaned source.
    + Fix avoid remove man subdir (clash with dpkg unpatch routine).
  * Drop file user-howto (7 years old, newest version 4 years old, and
    is apparently included in jackd.1 manpage already).
  * Use d-shlibs to resolve development library dependencies.
    Build-depend on d-shlibs.
  * Stop build-depending on scons (upstream use waf now).
  * Use system waf. Build-depend on waf.
      - Strip binary waf file (too risky to blindly invoke, and too much
        hassle unpacking and inspecting properly).
    Stop build-depending on python (only used by local waf now dropped).
  * Recursively-expand a variable and avoid a linewrap in rules file.
  * Enable waf verbose mode (easing porter work).
  * Setup get-orig-source routine:
    + include cdbs snippet upstream-tarball (suppressing its build-
      dependencies unneeded for normal builds, to ease backporting).
    + Repackage source, stripping DFSG-violating files.
  * Rewrite debian/copyright using draft DEP5 rev. 135 format.
  * Track symbols, but relaxed due to uncertainty on public library ABI.
