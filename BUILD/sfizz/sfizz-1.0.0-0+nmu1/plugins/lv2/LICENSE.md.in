The `sfizz` LV2 plugin is able to be built statically against all its components,
which is a desirable property for audio plugin hosts. These components include
`libsndfile` from Erik de Castro Lopo (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile).
`libsndfile` is distributed under the terms of the LGPL v2 or v3. As such,
statically-linked LV2 version of `sfizz` are to be distributed under the terms
of the LGPL-v3.0 license. You should be able to rebuild from source the sfizz LV2
plugin using any `libsndfile` version you wish to use.

See the file `lgpl-3.0.txt` or (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt) for more
information about the LGPL v3 license.

Most of the code in the plug comes from various examples in the LV2 distribution and
example plugins. As such, the source code of the LV2 plugin version of `sfizz` is
distributed under the same terms as the LV2 specification, which is the ISC license.
Binaries of this LV2 plugin dynamically linked against e.g. a system installation
of `libsndfile` thus have to respect the terms of the ISC license and BSD 2-clause
license. Check the LICENSE.md at (@LV2PLUGIN_REPOSITORY@) file for more
information about the license of the source code of the `sfizz` library and its
contributors.
