gbp clone
---------

Starting with gbp>0.8.1, here's an simple way to automatically fine-tune the
repository in the following ways:
- make git ignore any .pc/ directory (created by quilt)
- enable the "--follow-tags" when running 'git-push', so it's harder
  to forget to push packaging tags along with the branches.

To enable this, run gbp-clone with the '--postclone debian/gbp/postclone.sh'
option.
To enable this for ALL repositories cloned via 'gbp' (in the future), do
something like the following:

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin
    $ cp debian/gbp/postclone.sh ~/bin/gbphook-postclone
    $ cat >> ~/.gbp.conf <<EOF
    [clone]
    postclone = ~/bin/gbphook-postclone
    EOF
