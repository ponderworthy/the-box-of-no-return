    These controls are identical across all engines. However, the default value of <em>Volume</em> and its control range is dependent on the engine. Also, some volume controls go down to zero, while others (for technical reasons) go down to -60dB.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Vel Sens</em> controls how much incoming velocity level affects the actual volume. The amount reduces as you rotate clockwise, and is disabled if fully clockwise.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Pan</em> moves the apparent sound position from 100% left to 100% right. If <em>Rand</em> is checked then this becomes the position of the centre of left/right randomness and combined with <em>Width</em> gives you the possibility of a small range to one side or the other instead of randomly across the full stereo stage.
    <br>
    Obviously, the random element can't go more than extreme left or right, but instead of clipping to the limits (which would give a bias to the randomness) the actual range is calculated based on the reduced width.
