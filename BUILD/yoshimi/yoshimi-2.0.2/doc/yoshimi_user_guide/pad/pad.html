    <p>
    The PadSynth engine has two tabbed views in a single window. You will normally be shown the harmonic structure, the envelopes one (as it's name suggests) consisting mostly of envelope and LFO inserts.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Harmonic Structure</h3>
    (left side)
    <div class="tab">
    <B>Base Type</b> Base shape of the harmonic: Gauss, Square or Double Explonentioal
    <br><br>
    <b>Width</b> Width (spread) of one harmonic
    <br><br>
    <b>FreqMlt</b> Multiplier for base harmonics
    <br><br>
    <b>Str</b> Stretch <span class="warn">??</span> of the harmonic profile
    <br><br>
    <b>SFreq</b> Stretch <span class="warn">??</span> frequency
    <br><br>
    <b>Size</b> Size of the base harmonic (Hz<span class="warn">??</span> cents<span class="warn">??</span>)
    <br><br>
    <b>AmpMultiplier</b> Amplitude multiplier type: Gauss, Sine or Flat
    <br><br>
    <b>AmpMode</b> Amplitude mode: Sum, Multiply, Div1 <span class="warn">??</span>, Div2 <span class="warn">??</span>
    <br><br>
    <b>Par1</b> Parameter 1 for AmpMode (depends on mode slected)
    <br><br>
    <b>Par2</b> Parameter 2 for AmpMode (depends on mode slected)
    <br><br>
    <b>AutoScale</b> <span class="warn">??</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    (right side)
    <div class="tab">
    <b>base</b> <span class="warn">??</span>
    <br><br>
    <b>smp/oct</b>  Samples per octave <span class="warn">??</span>
    <br><br>
    <b>no.oct</b> Number of octaves
    <br><br>
    <b>Sample Size</b> Size of the sample
    <br><br>
    There is a button to give access to an overall <a href="../resonance/resonance.html">Resonance</a> that can be applied to the engine.

    Below this is a <a href="../wave/wave.html">Waveform</a> button which gives access to a highly detailed waveshape editor.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    (bottom)
    <div class="tab">
    <b>Bandwidth</b> Bandwidth in cents. The higher the bandwidth the wider the harmonic spectrum.
    <br><br>
    <b>Bandwidth Scale</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Spectrum Mode</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Overtones Position</b>This sets the type of overtone variation. For <em>Harmonic</em> there is no control, so the other paramaters are inactive. Similarly Par&nbsp;2 does nothing for <em>Shift</em> so is disabled for that variation.
    <br><br>
    <b>Par 1</b> spreads the harmonics according to the 'position' type.
    <br><br>
    <b>Par 2</b> provides a further variation on the harmonics spread.
    <br><br>
    <b>ForceH</b> This moves the shifted harmonics by a variable amount towards to the nearest actual multiple of the fundamental.
    </div>
    <br>
    If any of the above controls are alterered it will be necessary to click on the <em>Apply</em> button as the wavetable has to be rebuilt.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Envelopes and LFOs</h3>
    <div class="tab">
    Once again we have all the standard inserts. There are also the local controls found in AddSynth and SubSynth. None of these affect the wavetable itself, so there is no need for the apply button here.
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    The <b>Export</b> button that appears at the bottom of both of these views takes you to a filer window for exporting a complete wavetable with the total number of samples you have currently set. These don't include any changes in the sound produced by controls in the envelopes window.
