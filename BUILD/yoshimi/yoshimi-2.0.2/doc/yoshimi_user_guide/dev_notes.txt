Yoshimi User Guide notes 6/5/2021

This is the complete user guide for Yoshimi version 2.0
and later.

It is intended to be as platform and browser agnostic as possible, and uses
only standard HTML, CSS and .png images.

From the user viewpoint (as this is a guide) it must be light weight, easy
to navigate, with multiple obvious cross references and remain as
responsive as possible, so please do not add any animations, javascript or
other such extensions.

Contributors are also asked to maintain a writing style consistent with
existing content.

As far as possible, all of the sections are self-contained in their own
directories, but sharing a common CSS style sheet. Currently some sections
are little more than placeholders.

The background colour has been chosen to give good contrast with the text
and all images without the glare of pure white.

Where we want an unconditional hard division between upper and lower parts
of a page we use an 'invisible' full width thin image as below. This is
simple to implement and works regardless of page size and format. It is
transparent. A hidden line doesn't have the same isolating effect.

<img src="../images/boundry.png" alt="divider" class="wideline">


Numbering: Descriptive values that are less than ten use words.
e.g.
There are eight effects and we show number 3
You can have up to four rows of parts. The first row is numbered 1 to 16.
There are up to 160 instruments in a bank, in four columns of 32.

Finally,  to help with starting new pages, there is:
'basic_example_page/example.html'
