    This guide is intended for general day-to-day use, giving the most important information so that you can get the most out of Yoshimi. There is also a highly detailed <b>Advanced Reference Manual</b> in Portable Document format, complete with references for those wanting an in-depth understanding. This can be found on-line <a href="https://github.com/Yoshimi/yoshimi-doc/raw/master/pdf/yoshimi-user-manual.pdf">Here</a>.

    <p>
    Yoshimi is a fully polyphonic, multi-timbral, multi-channel software synthesiser.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sound is built up from combinations of three quite different synthesis <b>Engines</b> which, apart from using different methods to create a basic waveform, independently have control of amplitude, panning, filters, and frequency adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can have a <b>Kit</b> of up to 16 of these triple engine synthesisers with various overlapping key ranges. These enable you to create complex multi-layered sounds or small drum kits.
    </p>
    <p>
    This complete <b>Instrument</b> patch is then optionally passed through up to three effects such as <b>Reverb</b>, <b>Phaser</b> and <b>Equalisation</b>. From here output from this <b>Part</b> is given a number and assigned to an individual MIDI input channel, overall key range, Continuous Controller (CC) sensitivities and degree of polyphony.
    </p>
    <p>
    Parts, can have further <b>Insertion</b> effects applied to them before being directed to either the main audio output, an individual output (if such is available), or both! The main output can have <b>System</b> effects combined from all active parts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yoshimi is a highly complex synth with very extensive control options. Therefore, it is split up into a number of context sensitive windows to make this manageable. You will probably only use a fraction of the options available, but the more obscure ones are there for the occasions when you <b><em>do</em></b> need them.
    <br><br>
    <b>If in doubt, experiment!</b>
