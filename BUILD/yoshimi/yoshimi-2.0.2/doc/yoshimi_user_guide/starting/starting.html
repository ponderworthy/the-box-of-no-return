    The first time you run Yoshimi you will see the main window (shown on the index page) and also this virtual keyboard to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
    If all has gone well, clicking on one of the keys should immediately produce sound, and if there was a MIDI keyboard plugged in that should also have been recognised and be playable. The virtual and real keyboards work quite independently, although things can get a bit confused if both are on the same note!

    <p>
     Provided this window has focus, key presses will also produce sound. The layout is shown here for the standard QWERTY keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can operate the various controls with a mouse at the same time as playing on a keyboard. Some for the controls are real-time i.e. take immediate effect, while others only take effect on the next note played.
    </p>
    <p>
    To the left of the keys, there is a slider for pitch bend. Unlike a real bend control this doesn't spring back when you release it, however, right-clicking the control will return it to the centred position.
    <br><br>
    Alongside and underneath the keys is a spinbox to select the channel to send to. All parts listening on that channel will respond.
    <br><br>
    Next is a slider to set the velocity of notes being played, and then a rotary control to add a randomising element to make it sound more interesting.
    <br><br>
    You then have a counter to decide what octave to centre on, immediately followed by independent octave shifts for the key rows.
    <br><br>
    After the usual window closing button, there is a menu for selecting which MIDI CC (continuous controller), the final slider will emulate.
