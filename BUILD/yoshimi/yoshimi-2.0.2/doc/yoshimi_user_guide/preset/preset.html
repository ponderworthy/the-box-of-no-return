    These two very similar windows are the ones that open when you click on the blue 'C' or 'P' buttons. For both windows, at the top you will see the type of preset that is being managed - Effects in the images shown. Next is a list of all the ones of that type saved in the current Presets directory.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Copy</b>
    You can copy to either a file or to the clipboard. Each preset type has it's own clipboard, so you can have several different types held at the same time, but only 1 of each type. All clipboards are cleared on a main reset, otherwise they remain in place unless overwritten so you can quickly make multiple copies.
    <br><br>
    When copying to file, you can either select one in the list to overwrite it, or enter a new name. In either case the 'Copy to Preset' button is activated to perform the actual copy.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Paste</b>
    If there is no current clipboard entry 'Paste from Clipboard' is inactive.
    <br><br>
    Selecting a preset from the list makes the 'Paste From Preset' button active, and a click on this will then perform the operation. At the same time, the 'Delete' button is activated so you can remove this entry from the list.
