    <h2 style="text-align: center">Parts and Channels</h2>
    <img src="images/section.png" alt="Mixer Panel Window" class="image">
    <p>
    The first control is the part number you are currently looking at, and
     alongside this selection is an entry to decide the number of parts. These are rows of 16, and can be 16 (the default), 32 and 64. Initially the higher numbered ones take the same <em>channel</em> as the matching default ones. The is especially useful for <a href="../vector/vector.html">Vector control</a> where a 'column' of up to four parts can linked and controlled by a MIDI joystick, or similar.
     </p>
     <p>
     On the same line you then have what is both a shortcut button to open the window for the current selected bank and (with a right-click) an editable field for the part's current instrument name. Finally, there is an <a href="#edit">Edit</a> button for detailed part editing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below the part number is the MIDI channel it will respond to, and alongside this is the playing mode. This can be Polyphonic, Monophonic or Legato. Legato is not available if <em>Drum Mode</em> has been set in the <a href="#kit">Part Kit</a> editing window, and temporarily reverts to Poly with a red warning background.
    <br><br>
    Just underneath these are the switches to enable or disable the entire part, and to set whether <em>Portamento</em> between notes is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
    The four controls to the right set the respective levels for the entire part.
    <br><br>
    <b>Vel. Sens.</b> This sets the velocity sensitivity to incoming MIDI messages.
    <br><br>
    <b>Vel. Offs.</b> Velocity offset sets the point at which Yoshimi starts to actually respond.
    <br><br>
    <b>Pan</b> Is a normal panning control for the part and is directly linked to the one in the mixer.
    <br><br>
    <b>Volume</b> This is also directly linked to the mixer control for overall part volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nomally the <b>Controllers</b> button opens the <a href="controllers.html">MIDI Controllers</a> window. However a right click on it will instead open a window for the <a href="controllers.html#midiccs">MIDI CCs</a> window (shown at the foot of the same page).
     <br><br>
     The <b>Pan Law</b> menu selects one of three common panning behaviours. The default is close a constant power output. The first number refers to the apparent level of the side it is panned to, and the other number is the equivalent output when switched to MONO.
     </p>
     <p>
     Underneath 'Controllers' are the key range controls.
     <br><br>
     <b>Min Note</b> sets the lowest MIDI key this part will respond to. The <em>Set</em> button alongside sets this to the last note played.
     <br><br>
     <b>Max Note</b> sets the highest MIDI key this part will respond to. The <em>Set</em> button alongside sets this to the last note played.
     <br><br>
     <b>R</b> resets both the lowest and highest keys to their default values.
     <br><br>
     <b>Key Shift</b> provides up to three octaves of key shift in semitone steps.
     <br><br>
     <b>Key Limit</b> sets the maximum number of concurrent notes for this part.
     <br><br>
     The four controls at bottom right set the amount of this part that will be sent to each of the <em>System</em> effects.
     </p>

    <img src="images/mixer.png" alt="Mixer Panel Window" class="double" style="float: right;">
    <p>
    Yoshimi can operate simultaneously across all 16 MIDI channels, so it makes sense to be able to see all of these together, hence the mixer panel shown to the right. The part that is accessible in the main window is shown highlighted in this panel.
    </p>
    <p>
    This window gives a view of what is happening overall, and allows you to select instrument patches, change volume and panning, as well as selecting the incoming MIDI channel.
    If using Jack Audio you also have the ability to decide the audio destination from here.
    <p>
    If more than 16 parts have been enabled, a new menu appears to the left of <em>Solo</em>, to enable you to select which row of 16 that you want to manage. This cut-down image shows both multiple columns, i.e. more than 16 parts, and Solo in the process of being set up.

    Part kits can consist of up to 16 kit items, each with its own key range and full set of engines.
    <h3>Kit controls</h3>
    (kit item strips)
    <br><br>
    <b>No.</b> (checkbox) This enables or disables the kit item. It silences the part while doing so as it has to change the total number of engines for that part.
    <br><br>
    <b>Mute</b> Silences this kit item. It has no effect on any other items, or the part overall.
    <br><br>
    <b>Name</b> Each item can be named independently
    <br><br>
    <b>Min key</b> The minimum MIDI key number this item with respond to.

    <br><br>
    <b>R</b> Reset the key range.
    <br><br>
    <b>M</b> Use the last pressed key to set the maximum key number.
    <br><br>
    <b>Max key</b> The maximum key number for this kit item.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <b>Edit</b> (PadSynth) Opens the PadSynth editing window for this item.
    <br><br>
    <b>FX.r.</b> Sets which of the part's three effects will be applied this item.
    <br><br>
    (bottom row)
    <br><br>
    <b>Mode</b> This menu selects which kit mode that is used.
    <div class="tab">
    <em>Multi</em> - All kit items will sound over their full key range.
    <br>
    <em>Single</em> - Only the item that has the lowest min. key will sound over any overlapping ones. Beyond its highest note, the next one with the lowest min. will sound etc.
    <br>
    <em>Crossfade</em> - Pairs of items will fade from one to the other if they overlap, without affecting any others.
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>Drum mode</b> This blocks various pitch modifying controls for this part (such as Key shift, Legato).

    <h3>Effects</h3>
    This is the part level window which selects, contains and manages the individual
    <a href="../effects/effects.html">Effects</a> and their routing.
    <br><br>
    The spinbox selects which of three part effects you are managing.
    <br><br>
    The menu choses the effect, which will then appear an the area below.
    <br><br>
    The last menu determines the routing of the effects.
    <br>
    - <em>Next Effect</em> (default): will send the output of the effect to the next one in the chain.
    <br>
    - <em>Part Out</em>: makes the current effect the last one in the chain, effectivly ignoring any other following effect.
    <br>
    - <em>Dry Out</em>: This will send the effect output directly where part effects are added together. If an effect is set to Dry Out and then bypassed the signal will not pass to the next effect. <span class="warn">Explain dry out better!</span>
    <br><br>
    At the bottom of this window is a button to allow you to disable this effect without losing the settings, or altering the routing for the other effects in the chain.

    <p>
    <h3>Aftertouch</h3>
    <img src="images/aftertouch.png" alt="Aftertouch window" class="image">
    Each part can have independent Channel, and Key aftertouch. The controls shown are in parallel to the incoming CCs so you should not use the incoming CC at the same time as aftertouch, otherwise the results can be quite confusing. You can have several of the controls working at the same time, but not on both channel and key at the same time.
    <br><br>
    The normal range is from the CC value at the time the key was pressed up to the maximum for that control. If 'Down' is set as well, the effect will be in the reverse direction. i.e. down to the control's minimum value.
