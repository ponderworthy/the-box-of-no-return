    <p>
    AddSynth is the most complex and feature filled engine, so is split up into various context levels. The image shows your entry point with all the global controls. Much of this actually consists of standardised inserts that are used across all engines. Detailed descriptions of these are provided in the following sections.

    There are also subsections of this specific engine.
    <br>
    For a start, you can have up to eight quite different <a href="voice.html">Voices</a> and the leftmost button at the bottom of the window is the entry point for these.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next in line is a button for the <a href="voicelist.html">Voice List</a>, which as its name suggests is a list of all the voices, whether active on not.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last of these buttons gives access to an overall <a href="../resonance/resonance.html">Resonance</a> that can be applied to the engine.

    <h3>Local Controls</h3>
    <b>Stereo</b> Determines whether the whole of this engine is to be Stereo or Mono. If the box is not checked (i.e. Mono), there will be no <em>spread</em> to the sound, but the Panning controls will not be affected, and neither will the stereo spread of any part effects.
    <br><br>
    <b>Rnd Grp</b> (random group) Normally each <em>Voice</em> has it's own harmonic amplitide random element. If this is checked, then all voices that use the same waveform oscillator will be grouped so they have the same harmonic randomness, assuming this has been set in the <a href="../wave/wave.html">Waveform</a> window.
    <br><br>
    <b>D.Pop</b> (de-pop) Sets the time of a very short attack ramp up, to suppress the click some sounds might produce.
    <br><br>
    <b>P.Str.</b> (punch strength) Sets the amount of amplitude boost at the start of a note.
    <br><br>
    <b>P.t.</b> (punch time) Detemines how long the punch should last.
    <br><br>
    <b>P.Stc.</b> (punch stretch) Increasing this will give a longer punch time at low pitch notes relative to high ones
    <br><br>
    <b>P.Vel.</b> (punch velocity) determines how much the punch amplitude depends on keying speed.
    <br><br>
    <b>Detune</b> Detunes the engine by a small amount.
    <br><br>
    <b>Octave</b> Allows you to change the overall pitch up or down by up to eight octaves.
    <br><br>
    <b>relBW</b> (relative bandwidth) Modifies the amount individual voice and unison detunes can deviate from the overall value.
    <br><br>
    <b>Detune Type</b> The menu options control the amount of detune of the slider and whether it is a linear change or exponential (i.e. has more effect the further away it is from the centre position).
    <br><br>
    <b>Coarse Detune</b> The inner single arrows make a coarse step change to the detune, and the outer double ones change by ten times as much.
