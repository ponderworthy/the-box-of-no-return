    This provides an overview of what voices are active and an alternative route to the voice editors. It also has convenient shortcuts to the most commonly altered voice controls. This is particularly useful when making small adjustments to improve the overall <em>fit</em> of the entire sound.
    <br><br>
    Clicking on the <b>No.</b> checkbox of any voice line will enable the voice if it was off, and vice-versa. It will also make this the <em>current</em> voice for editing.
    <br><br>
    Next there is the <b>Edit</b> button which will open the window for work on that particular voice if it wasn't already visible. Clicking on this button when it is already active will again make this the current voice, and open the window if it wasn't already visible.
    <br><br>
    This is followed by two small icons showing an approximation of the voice and modulator waveforms.
    <br><br>
    The voice <b>Volume</b> control is next, followed by the <b>Pan</b> control for this voice.
    <br><br>
    The <b>Res</b> checkbox determines whether this voice is passed through the <em>Resonance</em> filtering.
    <br><br>
    <b>Fine Detune</b> is next, and the final control is the <b>Vibratto Depth</b>. This is the voice frequency LFO, and is only available if it has been enabled for that voice.
