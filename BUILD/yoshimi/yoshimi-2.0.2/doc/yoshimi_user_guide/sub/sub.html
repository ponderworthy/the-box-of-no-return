    SubSynth is the simplest engine from the point view of the number of controls. It is a single view of (in essence) a broadband noise generator with a series of <em>harmonics</em> filters that only allow comparatively narrow bands through to the output. There are also the following standardised inserts. Most of these are initially disabled.

    <h3>Local Controls</h3>
    Very obvious is the scrollable row of sliders. These represent 64 harmonic bands, the upper row being the amplitude, and the lower row the bandwidth. At minimum bandwith the harmonics are close to sinewaves, and at maximum they are very obviously noise.
    <br><br>
    The <b>Bandwidth</b> control (top centre) sets the overall range and the <b>Bandwidth&nbsp;Scale</b> changes the frequency scaling of this range that is applied. You can have quite narrow LF bands with wide HF ones, vice-versa or anywhere between the two.
    <br><br>
    <b>Octave,&ensp;Bend,&ensp;Offset,&ensp;440Hz,&ensp;Eq.T,&ensp;Detune,&ensp;Detune&nbsp;Type,&ensp;Coarse&nbsp;Det.</b>
    <br>
    These all work in exactly the same way as the ones in AddSynth, but are quite independent.
    <br><br>
    (overtones)
    <br><br>
    <b>Overtones&nbsp;Position</b> This sets the type of overtone variation. For <em>Harmonic</em> there is no control, so the other paramaters are inactive. Similarly Par&nbsp;2 does nothing for <em>Shift</em> so is disabled for that variation.
    <br><br>
    <b>Par 1</b> spreads the harmonics according to the 'position' type.
    <br><br>
    <b>Par 2</b> provides a further variation on the harmonics spread.
    <br><br>
    <b>ForceH</b> This moves the shifted harmonics by a variable amount towards to the nearest actual multiple of the fundamental.
    <br><br>
    (bottom row)
    <br><br>
    <b>Stereo</b> enables a stereo output rather than mono
    <br><br>
    <b>Filter Stages</b> This sets the number of stages of the <em>harmonic</em> filters, not the filter insert above.
    <br><br>
    <b>Mag. Type</b> defines the magnitude of the harmonic filter controls.
    <br><br>
    <b>Start</b> sets where in the cycle that note starts from.
