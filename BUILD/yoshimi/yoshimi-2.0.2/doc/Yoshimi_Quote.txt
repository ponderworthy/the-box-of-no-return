A car analogy.

A sample player is a drive along a straight, wide, almost new highway with only 2 other cars in sight, on a lightly overcast summer's day in a Ford Fiesta at around 40 MPH.

Yoshimi is a white-knuckle trip over a Swiss mountain pass in a blizzard, at night, facing donkeys, trucks and bandits, while driving an open-frame kit car doing 90 +

In recent times we've been able to dispose of the donkeys, and the bandits are on the run :)


Updated:
The trucks are gone, there have been considerable road repairs, and the few remaining bandits are in hiding. There are headlights so you can see where you are going.
