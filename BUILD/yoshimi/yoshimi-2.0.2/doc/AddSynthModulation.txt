Some people have been confused about how to use an 'external' Mod Oscillator, so here is an example:

Open the adsynth editing window and show voice parameters.

For 'Type' set Ring this will activate the mod oscillator.

Click on 'Waveform' and set the waveshape to triangle.

Now switch to voice number 2 and enable it.

Again select type as Ring (or any of the others).

You can now use internal for this voice or select Mod. 1

Change the internal one to, say Square

Rinse and repeat for voice 3, and you will find you can use its internal or either of the two previous ones.
