CrossFade.xiz is an instrument incorporating the new crossfade feature in kits. First released in Yoshimi V 1.5.0

As well as appearing to blend three different sounds, they have independent effects, and the lower and upper ones are panned slightly left and right.

If you open the virtual keyboard and use the mouse to run up and down the keys you get a very good idea of how the sound morphs.

If you look at the part kit you will see that there are actually four kit items, two pairs that meet in the middle. This is what makes a central sound seem to both fade in, then fade out again.
