"Microtonal Tuning.scl" and "Microtonal Keymap.kbm" are a pair of Scala compatible files that can be imported to Yoshimi once Microtonal is enabled in the Scales window.

The Tuning is a variation on the Even Tempered scale and incudes name and description fields.

The keymap file changes the relative positions (or omits) the notes in the octave. As this example takes two notes out it will shift the entire scale.

Finally, "Microtonal Ratio Scale.xsz" is a complete, purely integer ratio scale, that is a very close approximation to the Even Tempered scale. You can tell just how close it is by loading it, then alternately switching Microtonal Enable off and on.
