The .rg and .state file pair when loaded into Rosegarden and Yoshimi respectively produce a very pleasant classical style piece of music.

The simplest way to run this is to start Yoshimi first, then Rosegarden.

Next load the .rg file into Rosegarden, and finally the .state file into Yoshimi.

This should work for either Jack or Alsa.

If Rosegarden fails to link to Yoshimi for some reason, enter "Manage Midi Devices" and make the link manually.

It is important that the .state file is the last thing that is loaded. Otherwise Rosegarden will reset volume, panning etc. to it's own defaults.
