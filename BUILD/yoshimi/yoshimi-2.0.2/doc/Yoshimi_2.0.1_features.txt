V 2.0.2

In this release (in the 'doc' directory) we include a new user guide that is currently under development. This is entirely standard HTML and should be easier for general bowsing and reminders. The original PDF version is still available, but is now in the process of also being updated, and is titled "Yoshimi Advanced Reference Manual"

There are also a few more small improvements, along with bugfixes.

As usual, we welcome all suggestions and assistance - especially regarding documentation!

Yoshimi source code is available from either:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/yoshimi
Or:
    https://github.com/Yoshimi/yoshimi

Full build instructions are in 'INSTALL'.
