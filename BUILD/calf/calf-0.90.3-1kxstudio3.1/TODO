1. More effects

- auto-wah (might be integrated into filter)
- envelope follower
- better reverb (more features, use nested allpasses, use 1-pole 
  1-zero allpass instead of fractional delays)
- dynamics processing (Thor already did the compressor)
- distortion?
- windy rotary speakery stuff
- filter: more types

2. Some instruments

- some virtual analogue thing (something larger than Monosynth)
- FM (by reusing my MMX code, or something)

3. DSP library

- profiling framework
- optimized code (the one I have now only pretends to be optimized :) )
- underflow handling

4. Wrappers

- LADSPA: proper rdf (get clearance from drobilla ;) )
- better jack host (controls etc)
- BSE
- buzztard
- Linux VST
- LV2
  Message Context (for Organ)
  EPP (the rest of them)
  Mixing Controls

5. Organization stuff (autotools etc)

- correct compilation and installation of LADSPA plugins (current version is a hack!)
- switch to -O3
- get to work on 64-bit architectures
- i18n (gettext or whatever)
