Description: alsa to jack bridge
 This package provides two applications, zita-a2j and zita-j2a.
 They allow one to use an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide
 additional capture (a2j) or playback (j2a) channels.
 .
 Functionally these are equivalent to the alsa_in and alsa_out
 clients that come with Jack, but they provide much better audio
 quality. The resampling ratio will typically be stable within
 1 PPM and change only very smoothly. Delay will be stable as
 well even under worse case conditions, e.g. the Jack client
 running near the end of the cycle.
