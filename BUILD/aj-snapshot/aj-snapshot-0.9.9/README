Aj-snapshot is a command line utility to store/restore all ALSA 
and/or JACK connections to/from an XML file.

To compile this program from source, you will need these libraries:

- the ALSA library and headers (libasound)
- the JACK library and headers (libjack)
- the MXML library and headers (libmxml)

On Debian based systems, you will also need the development versions 
of these packages. These are marked by the -dev suffix.
E.g. you would need to have both libasound, and libasound-dev installed.
