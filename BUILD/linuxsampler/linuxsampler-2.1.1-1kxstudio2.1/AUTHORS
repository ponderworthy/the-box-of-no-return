Benno Senoner <benno@gardena.net> originally wrote the proof-of-concept code
"Evo" and ported LinuxSampler to the Windows platform.

Christian Schoenebeck <cuse@users.sourceforge.net> was and is currently the
main author of LinuxSampler.

Vladimir Senkov <hangup@users.sourceforge.net> was the first one who
actively joined the development of this application. He was especially
involved in designing the network protocol "LSCP" and it's implementation on
LinuxSampler side and in developing the MMX/SSE(1) assembly optimizations.
Not to forget the huge list of bugs he fixed.

Steve Harris made the filter impulse response analysis of the Gigasampler
filters and developed the first version of the Gigasampler style filters.

Stéphane Letz <letz@grame.fr> was responsible for the initial OS X port and
fixed couple of bugs.

Rui Nuno Capela was also especially involved in the "LSCP" design and
implementation.

Andreas Persson made a lot of important fixes and improvements regarding the
Gigasampler format handling. Especially the Gigasmpler v3 and v4 format support
was developed by him. He also had his hands on a lot of quality and efficiency
improvements all over the place, numerous bug fixes, and also developed the base
host plugin system and implemented support for the sampler being used as VST,
DSSI and LV2 plugin. He also did a lot on implementing and extending the SFZ2
format engine.

Grigor Iliev <grishata@users.sourceforge.net> added and implemented LSCP
commands for muting and solo-ing sampler channels, added sostenuto pedal
support, implemented the instruments database system and the Audio Unit
plugin version of the sampler for Mac and fixed a lot of bugs. Later on Grigor
was the major force behind unification of the sampler's complex engine code
base to a set of abstract base classes, which finally cleared the way for
providing multiple sampler formats with LinuxSampler. As a consequence of this
work he subsequently added the initial implementations of the SoundFont2 and
SFZ2 sampler engines to LinuxSampler.

Toshi Nagata was responsible for the initial OS X port and added autoconf
support to the XCode project file.
