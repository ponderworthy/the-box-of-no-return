{ The wait function can be used to suspend execution of the current event
  handler for the given amount of microseconds. Note that execution of an event
  handler might also be automatically suspended by the sampler in case its
  execution exceeded a certain limit of time.

  If your script might get suspended for the reasons mentioned above, you should
  be aware that all variables are global variables by default and all global
  variables are shared with other execution instances of the script. So after a
  suspended event handler execution is woken up again, the respective global
  variables might not reflect what you wanted them to be, because in the
  meantime other execution instances of your script might have altered them
  already. In case this is an undesired behavior for you, then you should use
  the "polyphonic" variable type for the respective variable instead.
