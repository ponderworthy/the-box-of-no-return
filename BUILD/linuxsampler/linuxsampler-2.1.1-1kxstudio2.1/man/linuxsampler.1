.SH NAME
linuxsampler \- modular, streaming capable sampler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B linuxsampler
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
LinuxSampler is a modular, streaming capable sampler. Currently it supports the
sampler formats Gigasampler/GigaStudio (.gig), SoundFont v2 (.sf2) and SFZ v2
(.sfz).

The sampler is designed as
backend, that is server-like console application. You will need a frontend
application like QSampler or JSampler/Fantasia, which provide a graphical user
interface (GUI) to control the sampler and manage sampler sessions conveniently.
If you prefer, you can also control the sampler from the command line instead,
for example by using the
.BR lscp (1)
shell application shipped with
LinuxSampler, which provides LSCP aware color highlighting, auto completion and
more. Since the LSCP network interface is based on a human readable text
protocol, you can also send LSCP commands by any other means to the sampler,
e.g. by using
.BR telnet (1)
or
.BR netcat (1).
You can find examples and detailed informations
about LinuxSampler's network protocol (LSCP) on
http://linuxsampler.org/documentation.html#lscp_spec

Various audio and MIDI driver systems are supported, like ALSA (audio & MIDI),
JACK (audio & MIDI), ASIO, CoreAudio, CoreMIDI, Arts, MidiShare and MME.
LinuxSampler can also be run as virtual instrument plugin. The following
instrument plugin formats are currently supported: AudioUnit (AU), DSSI, LV2
and VST. You can also load effect plugins into the sampler. Currently only the
LADSPA plugin format is supported for sampler internal effects.

If you are using sounds in the Gigasampler/GigaStudio format, then you may also
want to install the graphical instrument editor application called "gigedit",
which can directly be launched by LinuxSampler, allowing to edit instruments in
real-time (changes immediately being audible, without needing to reload the
sound files in the sampler).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--exec-after-init"
Executes the provided shell command(s) after initialization of application
completed. You may use this to automatically restore a previous sampler
session on startup, i.e. by sending a previously stored LSCP file via
.BR netcat (1).
to the sampler.
.IP "--help"
Print command line help and exit.
.IP "--version"
Print version information and exit.
.IP "--profile"
This option is currently not supported anymore, since the respective
profiling code is currently broken. Original behavior:
Output benchmark messages on the console. This reflects the current
efficiency as abstract BogoVoice count which is something like a
theoretical limit of the amount of voices which can be rendered in the given
scenario. It does not include all aspects of the sampler, that's why this
value is usually higher than what you really can achieve on your box. Also
note that this value is as well dependant on what instrument patch you are
using and what you are playing.
For a compact synthesis core benchmark, independent from drivers and
instrument files, you might want to use the one coming with the sampler's
source files instead (directory "benchmarks" of the source files).
.IP "--no-tune"
Disable assembly optimizations. Usually the sampler will detect CPU specific
features like MMX and SSE at runtime and use an appropriate assembly
optimized code in that case. With that switch you can disable this feature
and force the sampler to skip the assembly optimizations at runtime.
.IP "--statistics"
Output voice and disk stream count periodically on the console.
.IP "--lscp-addr IPADDRESS"
Defines IP address on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: any).
.IP "--lscp-port NUMBER"
Defines TCP port on which the LSCP server should listen to (default: 8888).
.IP "--create-instruments-db [FILE]"
Creates a database file with the given filename which can be used by the
sampler's instruments database system to maintain the user's collection of
instrument libraries. When this argument is given, the sampler will just
create the instruments DB file and exit. If the optional file argument is
omitted, then a default location for the instrument DB file is used instead.
.IP "--instruments-db-location FILE"
Overrides the location of the database file, which the sampler shall use for
its instruments database system
(default: /var/lib/linuxsampler/instruments.db).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP "LINUXSAMPLER_PLUGIN_DIR"
Allows to override the directory where LinuxSampler shall look for instrument
editor plugins.
.IP "LADSPA_PATH"
Allows to override the directory where LinuxSampler shall look for LADSPA
effect plugins. Multiple paths may be given, separated by colon (":") character
on POSIX systems (i.e. Linux and Mac), or separated by semi-colon (";")
character on Windows systems.
