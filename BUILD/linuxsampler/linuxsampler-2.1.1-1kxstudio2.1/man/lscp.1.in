.SH NAME
lscp \- the LinuxSampler Control Protocol (LSCP) shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lscp
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The LSCP shell allows to control a running instance of
.BR linuxsampler (1)
from the command line. By default, the LSCP shell will assume LinuxSampler to
run on the local machine and accordingly will try to connect to LinuxSampler on
the local machine. You can however also connect to LinuxSampler instances
running on any another machine available on the network. Since LSCP is
essentially just a human readable text protocol, you can also control the
sampler simply by using
.BR telnet (1)
or
.BR netcat (1),
however since the LSCP shell is aware about the details of the LSCP protocol,
it has various advantages, i.e. it provides colored highlighting of correct,
incorrect and complete commands while typing them on the terminal, automatic
correction of obvious and trivial syntax errors, visual suggestion for
completing the current command and also supports auto completion by tab key.

You can find examples and detailed informations
about LinuxSampler's network protocol (LSCP) on
http://linuxsampler.org/documentation.html#lscp_spec

The LSCP shell is designed as thin client, that is it forwards the individual
key strokes to the sampler's LSCP server, which will actually perform all the
LSCP knowledge based operations like syntactical error checks and suggestions
for auto completions. The shell application then receives the generated
informations and handles only output formatting on the command line terminal.
This solution has one major advantage: one and the same LSCP shell can work
with multiple different LinuxSampler versions and accordingly will still handle
different LSCP versions correctly.
